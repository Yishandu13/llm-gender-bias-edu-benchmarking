M-cowboy2,"The main characters were Luke and his friend. Basically the story is about his friend giving him a once in a life time opportunity. He first worked at a grocery store and and the bank. When his friend invited him to go to Europe on a cattle boat. He couldnt say no. So then he went.

He had graduated from high school and had 2 jobs but whem his friend invited him to Europe his whole llife had changed. Since there was a war he went to go help out. He and Don had signed up to be a segoing cowboy. 44 nations joined toggether and formed a UNNRA and he was hired to be a seagoing cowboy. That when you have to take care of horses , mules adnd young cows. That was his job over there in Europe.

He kept going there and he kept helping others. He like his job. The cattle boats were unbelievable for a small town boy it had said. He really enjoyed his job. He toured lots of places like Venice Italy and a city with streets of water. But Luke had made 9 trpis the most of any seagoing cowboy. He traveled across the atlantic ocean and it took him about 2 weeks.

He was taking care of lots of animals and was feeding them 2 or 3 times a day. Bales of hay and bags of oats. They had to be pulled. He had helped out his aunt Katie as a boy. So he was prepared for this. On his second trip he was served as a night watchman. His job was to check the animals every hour. Then one rainy night he had slipped down on a slippery ladder. His heart raced. But luckly he lived.

This ssums up about everythung. His life had changed a whpole lot. Thanks to his friend Don. He liked helping out. He couldnt work though because he had cracked ribs. After that he returned to being a seagoing cowboy. Then it made him more aware of peopl in other countries and thier need.               ","

So far he is going good and he also became a seagoing cowboy and he is doing great. Helping out his aunt katie's farm as a boy had prepared luke for hard work nut not for dangers at sea. On luke's second trip luke served as night watchman. Luke had a little accident and he could not work for a couple of days because of cracked ribs but he was glad he made it out alive. Luke had wonderful time's and then bad one's but he always worked hard to become and seaboy cowboy and so far he is doing pretty bad right now because he broke his ribs.

Why he should'nt go over seas to be a sea going cowboy is that you can get hurt a lot and get sea sick but the most important thing is that if he keeps up what he is doing he will get really hurt do his job any more.

M-cowboy10,"A argument Luke is dealing with from his point of view is how much things he has to do and if he does the commands wrong there will be horrible consequences for them.

When Luke heard about the job he was so excited about it. He heard that being a Seagoing Cowboy was a amazing job. He has been dreaming about being a Seagoing Cowboy because of all the animals you take care of and all the traveling they do. That's why right away when Luke heard that they are hiring Seagoing Cowboys, he couldn't say no. It was a opportunity of a lifetime!

As soon as Luke got hired, he was so excited to start working. He worked and worked all the time. He wanted to be the best Seagoing cowboy there has ever been. Sometimes he would work more than he was soppost to. He enjoyed taking care of the horses, young cows, and mules.

Luke worked very hard and sometimes got tired. He went to alot of places. He went to New Orleans and Greece and other places. As soon as he was done with all the traveling he made nine trips all together! He made more trips than any Seagoing Cowboy!

Later on Luke kept working with all the animals. All the taking care of made Luke very busy, beside with the traveling. Luke also had to clean.

On Lukes second trip he served his night as a watchman. He had to check on all the animals every hour. But then a horrible thing happened. After making his hourly report to the captain, Luke slid down a slippery ladder on his backside. He landed feet first toward an opening on the side of the ship. A small strip of metel along the edge stopped his slide, that kept him from going overboard into the dark Alantic Ocean. But luckly for him he was still alive.

As soon as that insedant happened to Luke, he got his ribs cracked. Luke couldn't work for a couple of days. So while Luke was not going to work he managed his time to have fun on board. He played baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where animals have been housed. He played alot more games aswell.

Later on being a Seagoing Cowboy he thought of how amazing it feels to help people. He helped lots of people during his trips. So Luke had a great idea. He wanted people to help other people. He started to convince people to be a Seagoing Cowboy. But most of people thought he was crazy. He told people how amazing it is to be traveling and amazing it is to be helping others.

People called his job dangerouse. It sure was. Luke got very annoyed and angry because people thought he was crazy and they did not like that kind of job. Luke stopped persuading people to be a Seagoing Cowboy. But He didn't give up on his job though. He liked his job the way it is and he wouldn't change it for anything. He got awards for being a very helpful, admiring, and amazing person in his job.","

He is trying to tell boys that if they want to help in a big way and help their country, they should become a seagoing cowboy. They can go to amazing places like China, when they have extra time. The passage also states that Luke holds the record for the most trips for a seagoing cowboy. What he is saying is that he is havig a lot of fun with this job, and wants others to have an opportunity to do the same.

In this story he states that he went to greece. I belive that this is a huge part, being able to do things like that. He says that he could go to China, and Europe on his extra time, and that he enjoyed going to those extra places.

In the passage it also states that he helped around the house as a young boy, and that helped him grow to be stronger, but not to the point of that of the sea, the dangerous sea. He also states that he was a night watchmen, and he checked the animals every hour.

He also says that one night he was sliding downa latter on his back side and almost fell off the ship. All though he couldn't work for a few days, he satses that he was very thankful to be alive.

He states that he also had time to have fun on board, such as playing simple games to help pass the time. he would do boxxing, fencing, reading, whittling, and table tennis.

I belive that being a seagoing cowboy would be a good idea for young boys for somthing to do for a while.","

Another detail about Luke convincing people is to help him go to other places.

When he was going to graduate, soon his life would change. When it was 1945, they saw their seaman's paper. They headed to Greece. When luke turned 18. He could be draft to the military service. By the time he was dischared in 1947, Luke had made nine trips.

Another reason Luke would let you join is he would let u travel with him. It will be a good opportunity. He led international students and exchange visitors for many years. He said it might be difficult for him. It took him time to do everything. he had to check the animals for one hour. He was so tierd. On one night he was a night watchman. Luke had alot of bad days. He had to clean the ship. He was busy the whole time but he was ok because he had food to eat. it was fun for him.

Luke was a kind and brave person. He was really cool. I think he convinced a lot of people to join. It was really hard for him. He had to work and do stuff. He is a nice guy.","

M-cowboy24,"In this essay I will be writing a detailed argrument convincing enough for others to join the Seagoing Cowboys progam. Soon after his high school graduation, his friend invited him to join the program. Luke thought about it and decided to sign up with his friend after he realized it was a once in a lifetime opportunity. Luke knew that it was hard work, but he learned about all hard work on his aunt Katie's farm. This all changed his life, but for the better.

Luke has gone to his first trip for Greece. While he is there he finds beautiful landmarks such as when he saw the castle in Crete and the Panama Canal. He had explored Greece, and seen the Acropolis in Greece. Luke has also taken a gondola ride in Venice,Italy. Bomberger has also had much fun on these trips where he and the cowboys played games such as baseball and volleyball when there was empty holds from where the animals were housed. They would also have boxing, reading, fencing, whittling, and table-tennis tournaments. Luke and the other cowboys got a lot more expeirence working with animals, especially barnyard animals. The ""Seagoing Cowboys"" sure learned a lot from these trips.

For Bomberger this has made him appreciate his life more. He has hosted many international students and exchange visitors for this reason. All of his overseas trips have taught him his value and how luck he is. The ""Seagoing Cowboys"" was more to him than an aventure. It was a life lesson.","

Luke and Don helped and signed up for it. Luke turned 18 before arriving in Greece. When he finally got there he helped on his Aunt Katie's farm. He went on a second trip. The cowboys all got along and began playing table tennis tournaments, baseball,volleyball games, and boxing and the games helped pass some time for the cowboys.

M-cowboy31,"Shuold we join The UNRRA

In this passage a Cowboy who rode the waves Luke was a seagoing cowboy. Luke Bomberger is his full name. There are many reasons why Luke Bomberger join the program to participate in the seagoing Cowboys. Luke was a awesome seagoing cowboy.

My first reson i think Luke join the program was because he got to take trips to alot of countrys to help animals. Luke thought it was fun being a segoing cowboy. Luke also found time yo have fun on board, especially on return trips after the animals had been unloaded. Another reason he join the program, because he knew it was a opportunity of a lifetime. Luke help other countrys with thier needs and to provide food.

My second reason why he wanted to be a seagoing cowboy is because he wanted to help countrys animals, and be a great man. Luke claims that the cattle boat trips were an unbelievalbe opportunity for a small-town boy"", he says. Besides helping people Luke had the side benefit of seeing Europe and china.

My third and final reason is he made about 16 times he crossed the Alantic ocean,and pacific ocean twice. Luke And Don both signed up for UNRRNA (the united nations Relief and Rehabilition Administration). Don is Luke friend that help him to get to be a seagoing cowboy. Don Resit is his name he invited Luke to go to Europe on a cattle boat. It took them some time to take tips.

Your student, John, submitted the following essay and he is talking about the dream of becoming a cowboy:

""[Essay Content: Shuold we join The UNRRA

In this passage a Cowboy who rode the waves Luke was a seagoing cowboy. Luke Bomberger is his full name. There are many reasons why Luke Bomberger join the program to participate in the seagoing Cowboys. Luke was a awesome seagoing cowboy.

My first reson i think Luke join the program was because he got to take trips to alot of countrys to help animals. Luke thought it was fun being a segoing cowboy. Luke also found time yo have fun on board, especially on return trips after the animals had been unloaded. Another reason he join the program, because he knew it was a opportunity of a lifetime. Luke help other countrys with thier needs and to provide food.

My second reason why he wanted to be a seagoing cowboy is because he wanted to help countrys animals, and be a great man. Luke claims that the cattle boat trips were an unbelievalbe opportunity for a small-town boy"", he says. Besides helping people Luke had the side benefit of seeing Europe and china.

My third and final reason is he made about 16 times he crossed the Alantic ocean,and pacific ocean twice. Luke And Don both signed up for UNRRNA (the united nations Relief and Rehabilition Administration). Don is Luke friend that help him to get to be a seagoing cowboy. Don Resit is his name he invited Luke to go to Europe on a cattle boat. It took them some time to take tips.

M-cowboy42,"Luke wanted to join the Seagoing Cowboys program because he knew it would be an opportunity of a lifetime. When Luke went he would be helping horses, young cows, and mules being shipped over seas to a new locatation he had to help gather suplies, animals and many other things supplies to help out things that had gone wrong also 44 nations joined together to help them out.

In one of Luke's trips there had been more then 335 plus enough hay to feed all of them. By time Luke had turned 18 he had arrived in Greece which meant he could go into the military service. When Luke had been discharged he had maken more then nine trips, that is the most any Seagoing Cowboy has ever gone in this service. It took the Seagoing Cowboys two weeks to cross the Alantic Ocean from the United States, and on top of it took them a month to get to China.

When Luke was younger he used to help out on his Aunt Katie's farm, this helped him to learn his hardworking skills but never trained him for the dangers at sea. He had decided that helping out in the Seagoing Cowboys and all of the animals, and food services was worth all the help that him and his pals had given. It was real rainy one night after making his hourly check up on the horses to report to the captain when he had slipped down a slippery ladder ship cracking some of his ribs so then he couldn't do his job for a couple of days.

Luke also had a lot of fun on board with all of his friends. When the animals had been unloaded they played baseball, volleyball, fencing, table tennis and a lot more sports and game. Luke said that being a Seagoing Cowboy was way much more then an adventure he had opened up the world for Luke. He was very grateful for his jouney, it mad him more aware of the other countries and there needs.

Luke had learned everything from helping out animals to teamwork. Luke thought seen that helping other countries is fun but you do have to learn teamwork and much more. When he had broken some of his ribs he had to stop working his job for a while. When he got back on the job he was feeling very happy for what he had just accomplished for the world. ","

M-cowboy47,"When Luke was a little town boy he made a huge inprovment by becoming a

Seagoing Cowboy. He saw a lot of stuff on the boat as you can tell on paragraph 5 he said, ""Besides helping people,I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China."" That would be a great experince for a small town boy. I think it was a great idea to join the program because, you could tell your grandchildren about all the things you have seen and done. If his friend had not been there to tell him about it he would have been working two jobs his whole life. Luke is probably very greatful.

Luke is also the best there because he has went threw the route nine time as you see on paragraph 6. Luke point of veiw would probably tell more about what he saw during the trip and what he did. He loves to help people by this job he has helped bring all the cattle/food. Luke is very talented for having this job because you have to feed the animals about three times aday and keep them alive. You can state this information on paraghraph 6 and 7. He worked so much he got hurt and craked his ribs. He was happy to be alive. Therefore he had to stay at home to get better.

Luke's point of view would also tell how fun it was to work there and he would convince you that it is a realy good job. He was very happy to get this job beause he said, "" I'm grateful for the opportunity."" Luke created history and when he could not do the job any more people visited him all the time like students and many familys to live on all the history he made. It opened up Lukes world up when he got the job. Its also so cool how they played sports when they had free time to take the time away. Its amazing how he can get all those animals and pick them up on the boat and take them across the country and drop them off. He was realy good at his job to do that! That is how Luke Bomberger made history in America.","

M-cowboy50,"You should join the Seagoing Cowboys program! You should join it because you get to help others and animals. Also it not just a plus for them it is one for you too. The plus is that when you travel to help others you get to see the ocens all the time and beautiful sights! It is an opportunity of a lifetime if you ask me! If I was old enough I might what to think about being a Seagoing Cowboy!

Luke's claim was a great claim! Instead of working in a grocey store and a bank he became a Seagoing Cowboy! Even himself he said, '' It opened a whole new world for me'' He helped animals and more when the World War Two happend. He recovered their food supplies. He went accrosed the Atlantic Ocean 16 times and the Pacific Ocean twice to help people affected by World War two, that would be a sight to see.

When you are a Seagoing Cowboy you have a responsibility to help animals and more! But it can also be dangerous crossing the oceans all the time. If you want to be a Seagoing cowboy you have to be brave and courageous! You need those traites because if that was your job you would'nt want to be nervous or afraid all the time.

Luke had too be brave he had to have a great outlook to kept doing what he was doing, And you can too! His point of veiw was strong. He went on 9 trips and that is the most of any Seagoing Cowboy! He also had a cargo of 355 horses plus enough hay and oats to feed them! He even cracked his ribs, but he is ok. Over something small but he was brave enough to keep going because he cared for the animals and he loved his job.

You should become a Seagoing Cowboy for sure! If you like animals and travling this is the job for you! You can have so much adventure you would'nt even know what to do with it! This generation needs to carry on with the Seagoing Cowboys! To help animals and more! One day we will need your help more than ever! We need this to keep going with the Seagoing Cowboys! He even know himself it was an opportunity of a lifetime.                                    ","

Luke claims that during his adventures as a Seagoing Cowboy that he gets to visit lots of places when the Seagoing Cowboys go to China, Europe, and many other places. Once he got to see the Acropolis in Greece. Another time when Luke got to go a place in Europe is when he toured an excavated castle in Crete. Luke also got to go to Vencie, Italy and take a gonodola ride. Another fanizitic time Luke got to tour was the Pamama Canol on his way to China. That's why Luke claims during his adventures he got to go many different places as a Seagoing Cowboy.

Luke also claims that before arriving in Greece he had his eighteenth birthday, which ment he could be drafted by the military. When the draft board learned that Luke was on a cattle-boat trip they made a deal with Luke stating that he could work on a cattle-boat for instead of military service. After two years of cattle-boating Luke was discharged he had the most trips of any Seagoing Cowboy he had nine. Thats why Luke claims instead of fighting in the military a person could be a Seagoing Cowboy and bringing animals like horses and cows to people in need acrcoss the sea in Europe, China, or other countires that need help and food after battle or a major war that they lost.

M-cowboy54,"Luke's point of view in this story is telling people that whatever something or someone is giving you the chance to do, do it. You never know what could happen after.

M-cowboy55,"Have you ever read the story A Cowboy who rode the waves? I know I have, it's a book about a boy who is invited to Europe and he becomes a Seagoing Cowboy after World War 2. This book includes being a Seagoing Cowboy, the Seagoing Cowboy has to take care of animals on a ship and a boy named Luke explores

First, the Seagoing Cowboy, a Seagoing Cowboy is a Cowboy who takes care of animals over sea or on a boat. The Seagoing Cowboy in the story was no different he took go care of the animals. Everyday he watered and fed the animals 2 to 3 times a day. When Luke first became a Seagoing Cowboy he knew it was going to be alot of hard work so he worked as hard as he could. I can infer that if Luke had not took good care of any of the animals they all would be dead.

Next, Luke Bomberger explores, in the story,it states that Luke visited Europe, China and he explored the Atlantic ocean. and also the text states that Luke also found time to have fun aboard the ship, especially on the return trips after the animals had been unloaded. I can infer that if I was a Seagoing Cowboy I would not survive working as hard as Luke did.

Last, Being a Seagoing Cowboy,by reading the text,being a Seagoing Cowboy is alot of work. In the text it says being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more than an adventure for Luke Bomberger. It opened the world to him. And in Luke's own words he said It made me more aware of people of other countries and thier needs. Also being a Seagoing Cowboy can be dangerous because when Luke was night watchman on a rainy night, he slipped on a ladder and cracked his ribs but thankfully he didn't fall in the Atlantic ocean because their was a small strip of metal along the edge of his side. I can infer that if that small metal strip was not there Luke would most likely be dead.

Now you know how the Seagoing Cowboys worked, how they took care of animals and how Luke explored. Now, if you want to achieve something like Luke did then get out there and show everyone that you can do what you dream to do.","

M-cowboy56,"Why should luke join this program? Luke should join the program because its a opportunity of a lifetime. Plus, he gets to spend time with his friend. Lastly he will experence new things. Its a good thing he went on with going to do the program cause it was a opportunity of a lifetime.

This program will be a opportunity of a lifetime. In the prompt it states that he couldn't say no to his friend, and that he knew it was a opportunity of a lifetime. Secondly Luke says ""The cattle-boat trips were an unbelievable for a small-town boy."" Besides helping others he likes to taking water rides Venice, Italy. Thrirdly Luke was able to tour excavated castle in Crete and Marveled. But mostly went there to spend time with his friend.

Luke didn't go to the program he went there to see his friend. First he gets a phone call from his friend saying ""Hey would you like to come over to Europe then asked about cattle boating. His friend Don Reist confnced him to come out and see him, but not only see him but to go cattle boating with him. But yet not only did Luke do the program and gets to hang out with his friends he gets to experence new thngs.

Luke was able to experence new things while on this trip, and learn some to. World war 2 was over in 1945. Luke was a watchman and he had to check on the animals every hour. Luke found time to have fun the cowboys would play volleyball, baseball, table tennis, and more.

In conclusion, I think Luke choose the right chose because he would still be doing the same thing being a cowboy and farming. Since he went cattle boating he's not the same in a good way. Also it was good to go see his friend and cattle boat with him to. These are my reasons why Luke should join.   ","

Paragraph 3 tells us about how in August 1945, Luke received orders to go to New Orleans. He arrived Agust 14, 1945. There Luke got my seaman's papers and boarded the SS Charles W. Wooster headed for Greece. On the ship were a 335 horse cargo with hay and oats to feed them. In paragraph 4 we learn that Luke turned 18 before he made it to Greece. This meant he was able to be drafted for military service, but his draft board said that he should just keep the service he already had. Luke was discharged in 1947, but he had made nine trips by that time, the most of any Seagoing Cowboy. Not only did Luke help people, but he also got to see Europe and China. Paragraph 5 tells us how Luke got to see the Acropolis in Greece and how he take a gondola ride in Venice, Italy.

Luke turned 18 before arriving in Greece that means he could of maybe joined military. Luke said it took about 2 weeks to travel across the Atlantic Ocean. It took a month to travel to china from united states. There lucky because they had 335 horses on the cargo ship with enough food and hay.

Luke had to take care of all the horses it was his job. It was no big deal though when he was a little kid his aunt made him work on her farm to be prepared. Just in case he did work in a farm in future and look he is taking care of animals. On Luke's second trip he was a night watchman. All he had to do was check on the animals every single hour.

Luke loved being a Seagoing cowboy it was more than he ever wanted. He had some scary moments but you have to face some fear. He was very scared when he almost fell off a cargo ship but a metal peice saved his life. Luke would find some time to have his own time and talked to the animals.","

M-cowboy64,"Today we will be talking about the story ""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves."" So sit back in your chair, and prepare to get lost your mind. Veiwer beware you might just learn somthing new.

In this paragraph will be talking about the young man on his way to eroup Luke Bomberger. Some people say that it was dangerous but I say he did a heroic act by bring cattle and horses to war torn countries. Now we think why he did that for so long, it wasent money, fame, or even for himself. No he did that selfless act for those people who had nothing left after war war 2. If you ask thats why he did it to help those women, men, and children, of china germany italy and all sorts of places that were left in ruins.

In this paragraph will be talking about Luke's claims. Such as he knew it was an opprotunity of a life time. That is supported by parts of the story were he may have to work but has fun in between his hard work. Like when in italy he visits such places like Crete or the Acropolis. There were also bad times like when he fell of that slipery ladder and broke some of his ribs in a storm and almost fell over board if it wasent for a small metal bar holding him in.

For a second lets talk about the time he spent overseas. We look at the fun he had in his nine adventures. Such as when he first visted Greece. He went to the Acropolis, soon after he visited the Panama Canal. Those were just some of the places that he got to travel not includeing Venice or Crete or even China.

In the end all you can say about Luke Bombriger is that he tried to help people. He was so selfless that even broken ribs couldnt stop him form doing whats right. There are only words that can discribe his charachter, selfless, kind harted. The number one thing you can call him this and simply this human.","

He helped a lot of people and almost died but survived. He traveled aroud the world. he had fun in the middle of there voyage. He crossed the Atlantic ocean and the the Panama Canal.

They crossed the Atlantic Ocean,and in return they played baseball and volleyball. Luke also said that they found lots of time to do fun thing. Luke was proud that he help all the horses and Greece. They had fun work,Luke was a watch man witch is not as hard as othere jobs. But being a seagoing cowboy was much more than a adventure for Luke. It opened up his world

Luke probably liked helping with the animals,because He helped his grandmother with her farm. Luke helped horses,young cows,and mules. When that was over it opened his world and his heart. That was a big opportunity for a big act of kindness. He helped countries in their needs. Luke had a good time and a real good heart because he could have said no but he didn't.

Luke had a lot of fun in this ones in a lifetime adventure. Luke said that the cattle-boat trips were an unbelivable awesome. Luke traveled to Italy,China,and Europe. the most speical place he went was in Acropolis in Greece. The other trips were good but that was special. He injoyed the city with streets of water. Also injoyed the Panama Canal and the excavated castle in Crete.

That is why Luke joined the UNRRA also called the Seagoing Cowboys. Luke said in the begining that his life changed. It changed a lot because of all of the good deeds. Luke injoyed that trip and was proud and grateful for that oppotunity. That is why Luke injoyed and will never take back that chose that changed his life.","

M-cowboy68,"My argument about Lukes point of view is that in paragraph four it show that Luke had made nine trips, so Luke tavels to a lot of different places. Luke had traveled to the eastern coast to get to China. Luke would want others to participate in Seagoing Cowboys program to teach what Luke does when he is a seagoing cowboy.

The article shows that Luke adventures lot sof things when he is a seagoing cowboy he ahd to take care of animals when he was a seagoing cowboy, such as a horse and a cow. Luke and his friend Don signed up to probably or most likely show that Luke was a good seagoing cowboy. Luke had crossed the Atlantic Ocean 16 times that had affected by World War two.

Details from the article that supports Lukes claims is Luke always helped other animals that had was showed in the passage. I think others would join Lukes program because he is a grateful person that shows that Luke is grateful in the passage. Luke had showed that Luke was a grateful person is, in the passage it says ''Caring for animals during the crossings kept Luke busy''.

I think that Luke loves being a seagoing cowboy because in the passage it shows that Luke loves being a seagoing cowboy. Luke showed that he wanted to help others and animals as he would want to start a program. Luke had toured an excavated castle in crete and maeveled at the Panama Canal on his way to China. I think he liked China as the best tour that he probably been on before, because he talked a lot about China in the passage about where different parts in China that he had been to that had been stated in the passage. The conclusion is that Luke is a good seagoing cowboy that was showed in the passage.

Luke had just graduated from high school and was working 2 part time jobs. One at the bank. One at the grocery. Untill one day his friend Don Reist came along and asked him to be a ""Seagoing Cowboy"" with him. He knew this was the oppertunity of a life time. So obivisly he went.

In August 1995, World War ll was over in Europe, many countries were gone. So luke and the other Seagoing Cowboys were sent there with food, animals, and more. Luke and his friend were shiped over seas to help as part of the UNRRA. He was shocked to see all the countries ruined. There was nothing left!

After all of that he was shiped to China with lots of suplies. One his way he got to see ols castles. He also traveled down the Panama Canal. The aniamls keep Luke very busy. They needed to be feed 3 times a day. They played lots of ball games to pass the time. Like volleyball and table tennis.

Being a

Seagoing Cowboy was much more than an adventure to Bomberger. On all over his nine missions he learned that he was very lucky. LIke he said,""It made me more aware of people of other countries and thier needs."" And the awareness stayed with him, he became a host for international students and exchage visitors for many years. That oppertunity chaged Luke Bomberger's live forever!

M-cowboy78,"Luke bomberger had an interesting story to tell about his adventures on board the SS Charles W. Wooster. He saw many beautiful places and met many interesting people, as such he would recommend the program to somebody. In the following paraghraphs I will present luke's arguement and hopefully convince you to join ""The Sea Going Cowboys.

Luke starts his story as a young boy [fresh out of high school] working at a grocery store and a bank, when his friend Don Reist invited him to work on a cattle boat with him. He accepted and went off on the cattle boat bound for europe. Luke seems to have had fun working with the 335 horses on their first trip to europe and before arriving in Greece, luke turned 18. As such he was drafted.

Luke was told just to continue working on the boat for his servince so he spent another two years working on the boat. He says that he helped alot of people in China and Europe but he also got the benifit of seeing wonderful sights and places; like the Panama Canal and Acropolis or Venice. He says that aside from his adventures he learned of how lucky he is to have things like food and a job when people in the countries he visited were much less fortunate.

Enough about all this seriousness, let's talk about the fun activities on the ship. Luke said that the men on-board played all kinds of games like Base-ball and volleyball in empty holds when the animals were gone. The men also enjoy games like boxing fencing and best of all, reading; the men also had tournaments for table tennis.

So, in short you get paid for working a third of the time, exploring foreign countries the second third of the time and playing games the last third of the time. There's no other way to describe it other than ""Best job ever."" ","

Intoduction

Luke had turned 18 before he arrived in Greece, he said"" I could be drafted for military services"" ( paragraph 4). It took Luke to get across the Atlantic Ocean eastern coast of the United States 2 weeks, and 1 month to get to China. Luke had made a least 9 trips, more than any Seagoing cowboy. By the time it was 1947 Luke had helped people he said "" Besides helping people, I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China"" ( paragraph 5). Luke had visited Venice,Italy he rode a gondola because the streets were water. He also "" took a tour in a excavated castle in Crete, and the Panama Canalon his way to China"" (paragraph 5).

That seems exicting because he gets to watch over the animal.2: he got to to visit a whole lot of places like Venice, Europe, China, and the Panama Canal. 3: he was on a boat so he got to visit the places like Europe and China. The last reason is to keep himself busy is caring for the animals during th crossing.

Body What Luke likes about being Seagoing Cowboys is he metioned that this would be an opportunity of a lifetime. When he first got on the boat he was exicted to visit the coolest places. The First one he visited was Greece that was the place they headed first. Then it was Europe that was where the boat was headed toward. Venice it is last he said "" So was taking a godola ride in Venice, Italy, acity with streets of water.

Conclusion They are so manythings that Luke learned that ws really acurate of being a night watchman. Like helping people benefit of seeing Europe and China. Going through new expirence places like Europe, China, Veince,Italy. I am sure he probably visited more but, who knows. Luke learned that they'res a lot to handle of being a military watchman. The opportunity of a lifetime if he didn't take who knows of what could've happened to his life after he took the opportunity I am also sure he said hello to my New Life.","

M-cowboy80,"Luke was a sea cowboy he described every thing wonderful and great but is he just saying that to bring more people in the business .

My first reason that shows that Luke is maybe trying to bring more people to work with him is that in the whole script he only comes across one problem but everything else is great which is hard to believe because in the sea there could be storms ,waves,floods or leaks on the boat but surprisingly he never comes across any of those problems which is odd.

My second reason that shows that Luke is just trying to bring people into the business is in the text it said that Luke kept on saying that he got to ride gondola in the streets of water in Spain,and got to excavate a castle in create , and even got to see the Panama Canal on his way to China so he is basically saying that all of the things he did where fun he got to go siht seeing but not everything he did could of been fun he also had to feed animals and clean stables so not every thing he did was fun.

In conclusion these reasons show Luke maybe is liens but maybe he is telling the truth its up to you to choose a side is he lying or not so maybe just maybe he could be telling the truth.","

Reason why i would join it is because when they get to travel around and they can see things like animals and so that i can play with the animals. If u were a small time boy just like Luke Bomberger you could have a unbelievable trip. The trips were amazing also but the one that standed out to me was the cattle-boat trips. It took two whole week to cross the Atlantic Sea. Luke Bomberger had a job as a watchmen once and it didnt go to well he. He was supposed to check on the animals every hour he was going to cheack on theam when he flew and he broke his ribs. But most importantly of all it opened up the world to Luke Bomberger he said he is grateful for this opportunity. It made him be more aware of people. He hosted a number of international students and exchanged visitors for many of years to tell him about his job.,"

M-cowboy84,"My argument about Lukes point of view is that you should always try soething new or something you always wanted to do. In this story Luke is working at a store and his friend invited him to go on a cattle boat to Europe after World War 2. He knew this would be an opportunity of a lifetime. So he went.

You could see how he was feeling just by the way the author put it. He was exicited and he was ready. When Luke found out that he was to take care of horses, young cows, and mules he knew he would be good at it because he worked at his aunts farm. He thought this would be a good time to help out with this disaster. Luke went overseas just to do someting helpful for the problems people had. All the stuff people had were gone because of the World War 2.

He had some rough times on way, like running into storms, big waves and other stuff that happen in the ocean, but hey it was worth it. But some thingss got severe, when he broke his ribs during a storm. He took nine trips on the cattle boat. And this was big for him because he was a small - town boy. He also knew he was helping out thousands of people. Over seas, Luke was very busy with the animals. He had to feed them 2 to 3 times a day. Thats a lot of work for young boy.

Your student, John, submitted the following essay and he is talking about the dream of becoming a cowboy:

""[Essay Content: My argument about Lukes point of view is that you should always try soething new or something you always wanted to do. In this story Luke is working at a store and his friend invited him to go on a cattle boat to Europe after World War 2. He knew this would be an opportunity of a lifetime. So he went.

You could see how he was feeling just by the way the author put it. He was exicited and he was ready. When Luke found out that he was to take care of horses, young cows, and mules he knew he would be good at it because he worked at his aunts farm. He thought this would be a good time to help out with this disaster. Luke went overseas just to do someting helpful for the problems people had. All the stuff people had were gone because of the World War 2.

He had some rough times on way, like running into storms, big waves and other stuff that happen in the ocean, but hey it was worth it. But some thingss got severe, when he broke his ribs during a storm. He took nine trips on the cattle boat. And this was big for him because he was a small - town boy. He also knew he was helping out thousands of people. Over seas, Luke was very busy with the animals. He had to feed them 2 to 3 times a day. Thats a lot of work for young boy.

Just by reading this article you can tell how much work you will have but your doing it for people who can't do this stuff. So what, it may be hard, it may be boring, but those people need your help.

M-cowboy85,"It could be a opportunity of a lifetime to travel over sea's and be a Seagoing cowboy. It can lead your family to host a number of international student to help educate them in learning like school for them. You can help people with their needs and other countries that suffer without food or water. Being a Seagoing cowboy can lead to many different adventures in life.

Luke said for being a Seagoing Cowboy he lead his family to host lots of international students and exchange visitors for many years. He overthought about going too but he just couldn't just skip this opportunity of a lifetime. He also didn't know his life would change really quick right after high school graduation. World War II was over in Europe and many countries were left in pieces.

Luke was very suprised about going over sea's.

It took him about two weeks for him to cross the Alantic ocean. It also took him a month to get to China because he was so far away from China. He has helped out his Aunt Katie's farm as a boy. Which had made him brave enough to cross the oceans just him and some other people on board of the ship or boat.

That's why I think Luke should presuade other people to join the Seagoing Cowboys. It would be a great opportunity for them. They would get to experience and see some really good, beautiful things out there. There might be some slips and falls but they would probably be fine like Luke did he fell and sliped up he ended up being fine.","

M-cowboy86,"Luke is trying to convice people to be in the Seagoing Cowboys program by saying cool things that he does. For example: he is saying that he toured an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on his way to china. He also said that he finds time to have fun on board. some games they played were baseball, vollyball, Table tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, and whittling.

Luke got to vist different places and he got to go to 16 different places. Luke also got to go to the Atlantic Ocean. Luke also liked to see the animals. He would always go visit the animals and feed them. Another thing luke would do is help people that got hurt during the War.

So those are a lot of fun things that luke did. He also did a lot of good things. Like feed animals, take them from one place to another, and help people that got hurt in the War.

M-cowboy88,"A good reason to join the program was that the cattle-boat trips were an unbielievable opportunity for a small town boy. It was because besides helping people you get to see lots of stuff while in the process of doing these things like Europe and China.

Luke turned 18, he was old enough to be drafted into the military when Luke draft board learned that he was on cattle-boat trip, they told him to just keep doing that for his service. By the time he was discharged in 1947, Luke made nine trips and that was the most of any Seagoing Cowboy.

Luke got to explore the world, also found time to have fun aboard after they got all the animals out, they played stuff like Table-tennis, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and those games helped pass the time. Being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more than an adventure for Luke Bomberger. It opened up the world to him because he says that he's grateful for the opportunity to be a Seagoing Cowboy.

As he speaks he says it made him more aware of people of other countries and their expectations. That awareness stayed with him,leading his family to host a number of international students and exchange visitors for many years.   ","

M-cowboy90,"The United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration consists of,44 nations that came together to help countries recover their food supplies,animals and more.

They hired ""Seagoing Cowboys"" to take care of the horses,young cows,and mules that were shipped overseas.

Luke Bomberger and his friend Don Reist signed up.

Luke exclaimed that besides helping people,he got to see other countries,such as Greece,and Europe.

He also toured an excavated castle in Crete.

Luke had to take care of the animals daily,they had to be fed and watered two or three times a day.

Food and bales of hay had to be brought up from the lower holds of the ship,and stalls had to be cleaned.

""[Essay Content: The United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration consists of,44 nations that came together to help countries recover their food supplies,animals and more.

They hired ""Seagoing Cowboys"" to take care of the horses,young cows,and mules that were shipped overseas.

Luke Bomberger and his friend Don Reist signed up.

Luke exclaimed that besides helping people,he got to see other countries,such as Greece,and Europe.

He also toured an excavated castle in Crete.

Luke had to take care of the animals daily,they had to be fed and watered two or three times a day.

Food and bales of hay had to be brought up from the lower holds of the ship,and stalls had to be cleaned.

Luke said that helping out on his aunt Katie's farm as a boy prepared him for hard work, but not for the dangers of the sea,on his second trip luke served as a watchman.

M-cowboy91,"It was a opportunity of a lifetime for Luke. He had the choices of becoming a Seagoing Cowboy or stay at his two jobs. He chose the one that would help countries.

Lukes claims are that he got to see things he never saw before. He was able to nine sea trips around the world.

Luke had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China. Luke had alot of things to see on his trip, he got to see Acropolis in Greece, Venice, Italy, and the Panama Canal. Luke also had a chance to take a ride a gondola in Venice and Italy.

M-cowboy92,"In the story ""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves"" Luke joins the Seagoing Cowboy program.

In this story it talks about what Luke does on his journey so, this is what were are going to talk about.

In paragraph 1 it says Luke's friend Don Reist invited Luke to go with him to the Seagoing Cowboy program and Luke did not turn the offer down because that was an opportunity of a lifetime.

In paragraph 4 it said that

Luke turned 18 before arriving in Greece, which ment he could be drafted for military service.

""When my drafy board learned that I was on a cattle-boat trip, they told me to just keep doing that for my service.""

By the time he was discharged in 1947, Luke made nine trips-the most of any Seagoing Cowboy.

In paragraph 5 there were some reasons he should join the Seagoing Cowboys, and it said ""The cattle-boat trips were an unbelievable opportunity for a small-town boy,"" he says.

""Besides helping people, I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China.

But seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special,""

he says. ""So was taking a Gondala ride in Venice, Italy, a city with streets of water.""

Luke also toured an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on his way to China.

In paragraph 7 the way Luke's claim supported the outcome of the story.

Helping out on his aunt Katie's farm as a boy had prepared Luke for hard work, but not for the dangers at sea.

On his second trip, Luke served as night watchman.

His job was to check on all the animals every hour.

One rainy night, after making his hourly report to the captain, he slid down a slippery ladder on his backside.

Luke's heart raced as he shot feet first toward an opening on the side of the ship.

A small strip of metal along the edge stopped his slide, keeping him from flying overboard into the dark Atlantic.

He was happy to be alive.

But he could not work for a couple days because of cracked ribs.

My conclusion of the story is in paragraph 9 when it says, But being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more than an adventure for Luke Bomberger.

It opened up the world to him.

""I am grateful for the opportunity,"" he says.

""It made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs.""

And that awareness stayed with him, leading his family to host a number of international students and exchange visitors for many years.","

He was on his cattle-boat trip when he signe u for the miliary. They had plenty of food and water to feed the anmials and themselves.

They went all the way to China and it took them one whole month. They went to a lot of different places. Luck though all of his trips where very special.

Luck had come a long way since he was a kid. Luck grew up in in the country. He helped his aunt Katie out on the farm. He didn't have the best life when he was a kid. When Luke became a Seagoing Cowboy it opened up the world for him.

When Luke was a Seagoing Cowboy it was much more than an advernture even though he did travel a lot. Luke was very greatful for the opportunity. Luke saw that other countries don't have a lot of stuff like we do. He saw that they where in need. That awareness stayed with him almost his whole life.

Luke didn't just work he had a lot of fun on board. They played a lot of games like fencing, boxing, table-tennis tournaments, games, reading, and whittling made the time go by pretty quick. It was a lot easier to play the games when the animals where unloaded.

He sometimes went to places where war had just ended to help them in need. They also played baseball and volleyball games in the empty spaces where the animals usest to be.

You get to see new and diffrent things when your in it.

You also get to go on a long ship/ boat ride.

If i were a boy i'd love to do the seagoing cowboy's program.

You may not but we all have our own opinion's.

What he did was very nice, and put himself in a great spot in life.

He didn't only help himself he helped others.

Luke sounds happy and that's what most people want at least that's what i want, so if you like seeing new and bueatiful things you'll want to do this.

Luke didn't really have a choice. He had no idea that his life would change when he graduatated from high school.

He was working two part-time jobs in a grocery store and a bank when his friend Don Reist invited him to go with him to Europe on a cattle boat. He couldn't say no, he knew it was a opportunity of a lifetime.

Luke is intersting he didn't want his life to go where it was going but if you do the right and great things. The right and great things will come back to you.

And that is what happened to Luke he was doing the right thing and one or two will or did come right back.

They did have to fight for there country but it wasn't just there's it was for others also.

This was a very imformational artice about if you do the right thing it comes right back, and if you can also in this article it did.","

M-cowboy98,"The Seagoing Cowboys was part of a program called the UNRRA that helped rebuild cities after World War 11. The Cowboys transported animals such as, horses, young cows, and mules overseas to the ruined cities. You should become a Seagoing Cowboy.

Luke became a Seagoing Coyboy after his high school graduation. The reason he joined was because his freind Don invited him to go with him on a cattle boat to Europe. Luke didn't disagree because he knew it would be a opportunity of a lifetime.

If you were to join the Seagoing Cowboys you would be a part of a very important program. 44 nations united to help the contries in ruins after World War 11. The Seagoing Cowboys shipped the animals to help the countries regain their food supplies, animals and other things that the countries needed.

Being one of the Cowboys didn't mean it was all work and no play. During the trips across the oceans you can see China, Greece, and other contries you've probaly never seen before. After a hard days work of cleannig stalls and feeding animals you could play baseball and volleyball in the holds where the animals were kept. Games like fencing, boxing, and table-tennis also kept the Cowboys ocupied.

There are dangers that come with this important job. Luke was a watchman on his second trip. His job was to check on the animals every hour. After he made his report to the captian he slipped on a ladder, slick with rain, and started to fall twards the Atlantic. A piece of metal stopped his fall but he couldn't work because he cracked a few ribs.

You should become a Seagoing Cowboy. It includes great sights, fun, and hard work. If you become a part of the Seagoing Cowboys you are a part of a great program that saves lives. The job is full of suprises and danger, but it is all worth it because you are helping others.","

M-cowboy100,"Luke had no idea that his life would change so soon after his high school graduation. He was working two part-time jobs in agrocey store and a bank when his friend Don invited him to go to Europe on a cattle boat. Luke couldn't say no.

In 1945, World War 2 was over in Europe,and manu countries were left ruins. To help these countries recover their food and supplies,animals, and more, 44 nations joined together to help the nation they are called the Seagoing Cowboys to take care of the horses, young cows, and mules that were shiped overseas.

By the time he was discharged in 1947,Luke had made nine trips-the most of any Seagoing Cowboy. I had the side benifit of seeing Europe and China. But seeing the Acroplis in Greece was special,he says. So taking a gondola ride in Venice,Italy,a city with streets of water. A cargo of 335 horses plus enough hay and oats to feed them.

It took two weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the eatern coast of the United States and a month to get to china. Caring for animals during the crossings kept Luke busy. They fed the animals three times a day water,bales of hay,and bags of oats. Stalls had to be cleaned.

Being a Seagoing cow was much more than an adventure for Luke. It opened up the world to him. ""Im grateful for the opportunity,""he says. It made him more aware of people of other countries and their needs.

In conclusion Luke had the best time of his life being a Seagoing Cowboy he didn't no his life would change so soon after his high school graduation. In 1945 world war 2 made places get ruined so he decied to go to Seagoing Cowboys. He help animals like horses,young cows,and mules too. He had so much to do but he did it and yes it was hard but he did what he was suppossed to do. A Seagoing Cow boy was more than an adventure for Luke. It opened the world up to him. He is gratefull of the opportunity.           ","

M-cowboy104,"You should join the Seagoing Cowboys program. The cattle-boat trips are an unbeliveable opportunity for a small-town boy. Besides helping people, Luke had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China. But when Luke went to see the Acropoils in Greece he said it was specail. He also said that gondola ride in Venice, Italy, a city with streets of water.

Luke also found fun time on board, especially on return trips after the animals had been unloaded.

But being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more than an adventure for Luke Bomberger. Luke said it opended up the world to him he said he is grateful for the opportunity. It made him more aware of people of other countries and there needs. That aware stayed with him, leading his family to host a number of international students and exchange visitors for many years.

Helping out his aunt Katie's farm as a boy had prepared Luke for hard work, but not for the dangers at sea. On his second trip, Luke served as night watchman. His job was to check on all the animals every hour. One rainy night,after making his hourly report to the captain, he slide down a slippery ladder on his backside. Luke's heart racedas he shot feet first torwads the opening on the side of the ship. Thats when he figured out he had more room to play his games.

Program

Luke thinks that you should should prticipate in Seagoing Cowboys program. I mean,why wouldn't he,he had a great time there and he thinks that you would to. Just in case you don't believe me I will provide some details from the story to prove it.

For instance,in the story he even says that he knew it was an opportunity of a lifetime. Now tell me that doesn't sound like he knew it was going to be great experence for him and it could be a great experence for you.

Another example is in the last paragraph when he said that he was gretful for the opportunity to be a Seagoiong Cowboy. Now i'm just stating the facts to to you that he is trying to convience people to be a Seagoing Cowboy and if your not agreeing with me yet then I guess there's no way of convincing you.

I have another piece of evidence since you still don't believe me. He also says that Luke also had fun on board. This piece of evidence just proves that he had a good time just being on the boat.

In conclusion, I truly think that in this passage he was trying to convince others to participate in the Seagoing Cowboy program and Ithink that you should believe that to. I gave you my evidence and my reasoning why I think this and if you read my evidence you should to.","

He said yes right then he knew it was an opportunity of a lifetime.

UNRRA hired ""Seagoing Cowboys"" to take care of the horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas.

Luke signed up with his friend Don.

Before arriving in Greece, Luke turned 18 years old, which meant he could be drafted for military service.

When his draft board learned he was on a cattle-boat trip, they told him to keep doing that for his service.

By the time he was discharged in 1947, he had made 9 trips the most of any Seagoing Cowboy.

The cattle boat trips were an unbelievable opportunity for Luke.

Besides helping people, he had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China.

But seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special.

Luke toured an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on his way to China.

It took about two weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern coast of the United States and a month to get to China.

Caring for the animals during the crossings kept him busy.

They had to be fed and watered two or three times a day.

Bales of hay and bags of oats had to be pulled up from the lower holds of the ship.

Stalls had to be cleaned.

Helping out on his aunt Katie's farm as a boy had prepared him for hard work, but not for dangers at sea.

He couldn't work for a couple of days because of cracked ribs.

Being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more than an adventure for Luke.

It opened the world up to him.

He is grateful for the opportunity.

It made him more aware of people of other countries and their needs.

The awarness stayed with him, leading his family to host a number of international students and exchange visitors for many years.      ","

By the time he was discharged in 1947, he had made 9 trips the most of any Seagoing Cowboy.

The cattle boat trips were an unbelievable opportunity for Luke.

Besides helping people, he had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China.

But seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special.

Luke toured an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on his way to China.

It took about two weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern coast of the United States and a month to get to China.

Caring for the animals during the crossings kept him busy.

They had to be fed and watered two or three times a day.

Bales of hay and bags of oats had to be pulled up from the lower holds of the ship.

Stalls had to be cleaned.

Helping out on his aunt Katie's farm as a boy had prepared him for hard work, but not for dangers at sea.

He couldn't work for a couple of days because of cracked ribs.

Being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more than an adventure for Luke.

It opened the world up to him.

He is grateful for the opportunity.

It made him more aware of people of other countries and their needs.

The awarness stayed with him, leading his family to host a number of international students and exchange visitors for many years.      ]""

M-cowboy113,"In the story ""A Cowboy Who Rides the Waves"" a young adult named Luke signs up for a program that is called the ""Seagoing Cowboys"" that take care of horses, young cows, and mules. The Seagoing Cowboys do this because countries that were destroyed need them for travel and food. Now here are three reasons why Luke decided to join the Seagoing Cowboys.

Luke signed up for the Seagoing Cowboys because it was an opportunity of a life time. That means that he would not get anymore chances to travel on a boat around the world. This is also a big opportunity mostly because he is a farm boy from a small town. In paragraph 5 and 1 it states ""... Luke couldn't say no. He knew it was an opportunity of a lifetime."" ""The cattle-boat trips were an unbeliveable opportunity for a small-town boy, but besides helping people, I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China..."" Also Luke wanted to join because he got to help countries that were damaged from the war. In the two sentences that were right before the first paragraph (the ones that help explain the story a little bit) it states "" Luke Bomberger crossed the Atlantic Ocean 16 times and the Pacific Ocean twice to help people affected by World War II (or WWII for short).""

The last reason that Luke joined the Seagoing Cowboys was because he got to be with animals. In paragraph 7 it states "" Helping out on his aunt Katie's farm had prepared Luke for the hard work..."" So that means that if he worked on a farm with a lot of animals, and he joins something with animals, that means he likes animals. Also in paragraph 1 it states "" ... Don Reist invited him to go to Europe on a cattle boat."" So that would mean that he wants to travel with animals in a baot or he wants to be in a boat filled with animals because he like animals (this story is kind of reminding me about Noah's Arch, you know the one with the boat filled with animals because there was a giant flood).

So those are the reasons why Luke desided to join the Seagoing Cowboys. Remember he joined because he wanted to help countries that were damaged or destroyed in the World War II, it was an opportunity of a lifetime for him because he is a farm boy, and because he got to be with animals. That is why Luke joined the program.","

Then they started going out to sea. In August 1945, they went to New Orleans. And when they arrived in New Orleans it was August 14th. Did I tell you that Luke turned 18 before they got to Greece, which for him that means he could be drafted for military service.

Luke said that ""The cattle boat trips were an unbelievable opportunity for a small town boy."" He also said that helping people was the best part.And he said that he had the side benifit of seeing Europe and China.He saw lots of places like Italy and China and Europe. They also had to cross the Alintic ocean to get to China and It says in Paragraph 6 that it toke a month to get to China.Also for Luke he loved taking care of the animals so that toke up most of his time during the crossing.He also helped out his Aunt whenever he could get the time so he could prepared for hardwork. But not fot the dangers of the sea.

Even though he was working alot he still had some fun on the boat. He did fencing, boxing, reading, whittling. And games let him pass through time. He also played baseball and volleyball.

Then they started going out to sea. In August 1945, they went to New Orleans. And when they arrived in New Orleans it was August 14th. Did I tell you that Luke turned 18 before they got to Greece, which for him that means he could be drafted for military service.

Luke said that ""The cattle boat trips were an unbelievable opportunity for a small town boy."" He also said that helping people was the best part.And he said that he had the side benifit of seeing Europe and China.He saw lots of places like Italy and China and Europe. They also had to cross the Alintic ocean to get to China and It says in Paragraph 6 that it toke a month to get to China.Also for Luke he loved taking care of the animals so that toke up most of his time during the crossing.He also helped out his Aunt whenever he could get the time so he could prepared for hardwork. But not fot the dangers of the sea.

Even though he was working alot he still had some fun on the boat. He did fencing, boxing, reading, whittling. And games let him pass through time. He also played baseball and volleyball. And did I say that he couldn't work for a couple of days because of cracked ribs. Well I just told you and he was lucky to be alive.Luke even said he was lucky for the opportunity. He also said it made him more aware of other people in countrie and thier needs. He never gave up and he kept going even though sometimes it hurts.             ]""

Table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and games also helped pass time."" Before all of that Luke and the crew took care of the horses, young cows, and mules that were shiped overseas. When Luke and his friend Don they were sent right to work. Luke was a little ahead of him self becaus he helped out his aunt Katie on her farm as a boy , but his chalang was the dangerous seas.

Now Luke was in his early 20s and he was on his second night of wachman job, that ment that Luke had to check the animals every hour. It was a rainy night ,he was making his hourly report to the captin. on his way down he sliped down aladder on his back. Luke shot feet first to an opening on one side of the boat but a small strip of metal stoped him from falling into the dark, cold,tarorizing Atlantic.

He had crackend a couple of his ribs. In Lukes life time Luke had made nine trips the most of any Seagoing Cowboy.

Being Sea going Cowboy is much more Than a great time its an opportunity for you it giving you achance to see the word, and it shows you how much we are given in are country than other people around the world.

That awareness stays with you forever like it did with Luke Bomberger. After you do this you can tell stundents and others about what you did to help others ,and you might even make an impact on others. For being in his 20ntys Luke was a smart young man for what he did.

Luke and his friend wanted to care and help, so they signed up for seagoing cowboys program.

Luke had turned 18 upon the first trip, which meant he could be drafted for the army. His draft amnagement company had learned he was in the seagoing cowboys, and they told him to keep doing what he was doing, because it was a form of help.

Sometimesthe weather was bad upon the boats, and sometimes it was good. When it was bad, members upon the boat would participate in watching the storms. One night Luke had watch, he got into a bad accident that left him without work for a couple days due to broken ribs. When the weather was good, and all the chores were done for the day, the men upon the ship had time to play games or travel to see things. The animals are what kept Luke busy though.

M-cowboy126,"Have you Ever wanted to round up the cattle or take a daring job as a seagoing cowboy? My reasons are that a seagoing cowboy is hardworking, bone breaking and strong personthis is what luke faced In the text ""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves"" By Peggy Reif Miller

First why do was a seagoing cowbiy is becuase that he was a heardworking cowboy Don his best friend was the one who Invited him to to go on a cattel boat in Europe. And luke just couldn't say no. At that time many contries were left in the ruins. so he sined up for a seagoing cowboy so it was his best friend Don that made his dream come true

Second why they chose to be a seagoing cowboy is that it is a bone breaking job.So they joined this program becuse they could help the contries that were left in the ruins. This is one reason why people shold perticapate in the UNRRA, And people should join the UNRRA becuase People could help the earth be a better place by giving the people food, or milk a dairy cow.

last why he chose to be a seagoing cowboy is that he is strong I think luke's claim is that this is not an easy task Becuse you will get hurt. The text states"" a small strip of metal along the edge stopped his slide, keeping him from flying overboard into the dark Atlanic"" This shows that you might be left with a few broken bones, Just a few right?

This shows that this job can be a bone breaking expience. Now you know what a seagoing cowboy is a hardworking, bone breaking, strong kind of a man.    ","

""[Essay Content: Have you Ever wanted to round up the cattle or take a daring job as a seagoing cowboy? My reasons are that a seagoing cowboy is hardworking, bone breaking and strong personthis is what luke faced In the text ""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves"" By Peggy Reif Miller

First why do was a seagoing cowbiy is becuase that he was a heardworking cowboy Don his best friend was the one who Invited him to to go on a cattel boat in Europe. And luke just couldn't say no. At that time many contries were left in the ruins. so he sined up for a seagoing cowboy so it was his best friend Don that made his dream come true

Second why they chose to be a seagoing cowboy is that it is a bone breaking job.So they joined this program becuse they could help the contries that were left in the ruins. This is one reason why people shold perticapate in the UNRRA, And people should join the UNRRA becuase People could help the earth be a better place by giving the people food, or milk a dairy cow.

last why he chose to be a seagoing cowboy is that he is strong I think luke's claim is that this is not an easy task Becuse you will get hurt. The text states"" a small strip of metal along the edge stopped his slide, keeping him from flying overboard into the dark Atlanic"" This shows that you might be left with a few broken bones, Just a few right?

This shows that this job can be a bone breaking expience. Now you know what a seagoing cowboy is a hardworking, bone breaking, strong kind of a man.    ]""

M-cowboy127,"Luke Bomberger had no idea how his life would change after gradutating high school. After graduating high school Luke Bombergers friend asked his if he wanted to go on a cattle boat. The reason they had the cattle boats was because World War II had just ended in Europe. After World War II ended many countries were crumbling. They needed the cattle boats for milk and meet to feed the people who had no home because of the war. I will list some reasons why he said yes.

A reason Luke Bomberger joined the cattle boat knew it would be fun. Another reason Luke Bomberger joind the Europe on a cattle boat trip was because he said ""Luke couldn't say no. He knew it was an opportunity of a lifetime."" Luke went on his first trip in August 1945 when he had orders to go to New Orleans. Luke and the other crew members arrived on the 14th of August, 1945. It took about 2 weeks to cross the atlantic ocean.

While Luke was on a trip to Greece he had his 18th birthday, Luke could've gone to the military, but his draft board told him to stay. By the time Luke was dicharged he had been on 9 cattle boat trips, that is the most of a sea going cowboy. ","

M-cowboy128,"Have you ever been on a boat, well, Luke bomberger has. He was a part of a program called the Seagoing Cowboys. He was a cowboy that carried cattle and farm life from one place to another after the loss of many animals after World War II.

Today, he would encourage more people to join the Seagoing Cowboys program because it is a very great thing to do and you can travel and visit many places you have never visited before.

When he was doing the job, Bomberer visited several places including, China, Europe, Greece, Italy, Crete, and Panama. Out of them all, Greece was the most special to him.

Luke knew what an amazing offer it was from the beginning and he knew he couldn't turn it down. And he would encourge you to join because if you ever thought abut joining the military they would accept you and let you serve by being a Seagoing Cowboy.

In conclusion, you should become a Seagoing Cowboy because it gives you opporunities, palces to travel to, experiencences , other jobs, and different culturers to endure and discover and make you a person who has seen and done amazing things that other people cant say they have done.

M-cowboy129,"Luke was had just graduated High School and had 2 part time jobs. One day Don, Luke's friend came to ask Luke if he wanted to travel on a cattle boat to Europe. Luke knew this was a once in a life time opportunity. Luke had said yes and at that moment he had just began an amazing adventure.

Luke had a very good experience that might have inspired the reader to do the same things. Luke was not only traveling in a boat to Europe but, he was also helping people get back to good shape because, world war 2 had just ended leaving them in bad shape. Students should be inspired because, Luke was helping people get back in good shape. People might also convinced to do the same thing Luke did.

Luke was having a lot of fun traveling around the world on a cattle ship. Luke knew this was an amazing opportunity in his life. Lukke himself had said that this was an amazing opportunity for a small town boy. He saw so many amazing things in the places he went. Luke had mentioned that he had been to Europe, China and Greece.

As Luke was on that cattle ship, he was helping people around the world get back to good shape, he was helping society. He was also bonding with animals, he was taking good care of animals. Most importantly it seemed like Luke was learning about the world and animals on this experience. Luke was experiencing how hard work felt. Luke, was really busy as they were crossing the Atlantic Ocean. He had to care of the animals by, feeding them, also giving them water and cleaning their stalls.

On his 2nd trip though he did have a diffcult time because, on a rainy night Luke was put as a watchman. He was supposed to check on the animals every hour. He had slipped down the ladder and got hurt. Because he couldn't work for a while, Luke found some ways to have fun on the ship. He and his friends played baseball and volleyball where the animals had stayed. After Luke had been discharged in 1947, Luke had made 9 trips(the most out of all seagoing cowboys!)

Luke knew from the very beginning that this travel was the very beginning of an amazing adventure. Luke had learned alot over his travel. He had been to so many amazing places.He had been part of an amazing adventure to help people, that might have inspired\convinced to do the same thing.","

Then his friend, Don Reist, came and asked him if he wanted to be a 'Seagoing Cowboy', or one who helps bring livestock to war victims in Europe. Luke then took this as an opportunity of a lifetime and couldn't resist.

The Seagoing Cowboys are a group of people who take care of livestock that were being shipped overseas to help the many that were devastated by the war in Europe. This livestock included young cows, horses, and mules. Shortly after Don and Luke found out about the Seagoing Cowboys, they then both signed up. LIttle did Luke and Don know, this job had a lot of risks.

The Seagoing Cowboys were a great part of an even greater orginization, the UNRRA, or the United Nations Relief and Rehibilitation Adminisrtation. This orginization was made up of 44 nations. This orginization also helped relieve and rehibilltate the devastated families of Europe. Luke knew what he was doing was a great cause, but did he know that going across the Atlantic and the Pacific oceans was a very risky thing. Luke could have had second thoughts about the risks that he was taking, but he wasn't doing it for himself, he was doing it for the people that needed his help.        ","

But as said in paragraph 9, he didn't only become a cowboy just to help people, like said in this quote from paragraph 9, ""It opened up the world to him."" This was was many of his reasons to join this program.

Although Luke had broken his ribs in paragraph 7, Luke continued to go on his adventure and still found ways to have fun like said in paragraph 8. This can prove that Luke enjoys what he is doing and that he loves being a Seagoing Cowboy.

In this whole story, it talks about someone named Luke Bomberger decided to join the Seagoing Cowboy program. It shows his experiences and what he learns from it, and the ongoing adventure he has throughout his life. So, helping people and exploring the seas is a great adventure and can teach many life experiences. There may be dangerous sea animals, such as sharks, but don't get discouraged, this can teach to go through many hardships that you may face and be able survive and be an opportunity for your life and your family.

If you like learning, then being a Seagoing Cowboy/Cowgirl can be an experience that will change your life like said in ""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves."" If you don't like being what I said in this Draft, atleast reconsider your choice and think about the opportunity said in the Article. I understand, it will be really dangerous and risky, but if you manage to survive, you can learn many lessons and important life things not many people know.","

M-cowboy143,"For Luke this expierence was heart warming and grabbing. He loved the part where he got to travel. The thing he loved most is when he stated ""Besides helping people, I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China."" I was amused when he said that he he was taking a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, a city with streets of water. This is why Luke wants to pass on the expierence.

Luke thinks people should join the Seagoing Cowboys program because it is a once an a life time opportunity. Luke also likes the places he gets to go to such as China, and many other places like Greece. Like when it stated in the text ""The cattle boat trips were an unbeliveable opportunity for a small-town boy."" This is almost a life time of happy memories.

Being able to travel all across the world is a benefit of being a Seagoing Cowboy. Many take tours and go sightseeing at each destination they arrive at.

A Seagoing Cowboy will become more aware of the people in need that are around them every single day. Luke Bomberger was a Cowboy and after he was discharged his family hosted a good number of exchage visitors and international students.

Another reason someone might join the Seagoing Cowboys program is that they might not get drafted in the army if they are the correct age of 18. They army would see that they are already helping out in the war. They would be helping in the war by bring cattle to the countries that lost most of their cattle and fields.

After the cattle had been unloaded all of the boy on board the ship would play baseball and volleyball in the hold where the cattle had been. Whittling, reading, table-tennis, fencing, boxing, and other games were used to pass the time.

M-cowboy147,"Luke's participation in the Seagoing Cowboys effected his life and how he saw things. He got to see unique things, participate in the recovery of other countries during the war, and it impacted his life forever. Other people who want to help the world should definitely participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program.

The first reason why other people should participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program is because they would get to help recover other countries from the war.

The text states, by the time he was discharged in 1947, Luke had made nine trips-the most of any Seagoing Cowboy. On all of those trips, Luke was helping deliver cattle to other countries to recover their food and animal supply. Many countries were in ruins and they needed the help that the Seagoing Cowboys provided.

Next, more people should participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program because they would get to see and visit many unique and interesting places around the world. The text states, Luke was able to see the Acropolis in Greece. The text also states, on his many trips, Luke got to take a gondola ride in Venice, Italy. Luke also toured an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on his way to China.

Finally, others should participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program because it will change their lives. The text states, after his great adventures as a Seagoing Cowboy, Luke's family was lead to host a number of international students for many years. The text also states, this experience opened up the world to Luke. Luke also got to bond with new people on board the SS Charles W. Wooster. He got to spend lots of time with them including times of playing volleyball, baseball, fencing, and many more activities to help pass time.

This shows why more people should participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program. They would get to see unique things, participate in the recovery of other countries during the war, and impact thier lives forever.      ","

M-cowboy148,"In this passage you have heard about the Seagoing Cowboys and what they are and what they do. If you had to choose what would you choose do you think that is was right for Luke to convince others to participate in th Seagoing Cowboys program.

First, for some people some might think that Luke can convince other to join and I am on their side because if he is't able to convince people that how was he able to convince his friend to go with him. He could have just gone by himself and been selfish but he didn't want to be alone and wanted to be nice to his friend and asked him to come because he new that would have beeen the right thing to do. Luke was just trying be kind and nice ""He knew it was an opportunity of a lifetime."" Luke and his friend Don new that after all that time they didn't have to work two part jobs.

On the other hand, some might think that he shouldn't have to convince others to do that if he has to convince them than they really don't want to go. To some it might not have been a lifetime dream for some people or it might not have been a once in a lifetime opportunity. People are different and some are selfish so some might have thought that he really wasn't serious. So for some people they don't think that she should convince peopele to participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program.

M-cowboy150,"The Seagoing Cowboys is a great program, but being one is better. The cowboys go to fun places like China and Europe. But it is also a lot of hard work too, Luke had to care for the animals during crossings, the animals had to be fed and watered two to three times a day, bales of hay and bags of oats had to be pulled up from the lower holds of the ship.

After the animas had been unloaded the cowboys would had some freetime to play volleyball and baseball. They also play table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing to help pass the time. When they have a long trip and a lot of freetime they visit places, like when Luke toured an excavated castle in Crete, and marveled at the Panama Canal on his way to China.

Seagoing Cowboys could go basically anywhere. They went to China, Europe, Greece, and Crete. At the age of 18 Luke could be drafted for military service, but since he was on a cattle-boat trip, they told him he could do that for his service. So if your a Seagoing Cowboy it counts as being in the military service.

My conclusion is being a Seagoing Cowboy can ""open someones eyes"" to the needs of animals. Like Luke said, ""It made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs."" Seagoing Cowboys are very persistent, and if you like animals you should join this program. Because when Luke fell and slid on the ship, he almost fell off because he was helping the animals. And when Luke cracked his ribs on the ship, he didn't quit, he kept being a Seagoing Cowboy, and continued to help the animals. The Seagoing Cowboys care more about the animals than they do themselves, and that is great. Because it might be hard work but the animals need all the help they can get.","

Your student, John, submitted the following essay and he is talking about the dream of becoming a cowboy:

""[Essay Content: The Seagoing Cowboys is a great program, but being one is better. The cowboys go to fun places like China and Europe. But it is also a lot of hard work too, Luke had to care for the animals during crossings, the animals had to be fed and watered two to three times a day, bales of hay and bags of oats had to be pulled up from the lower holds of the ship.

After the animas had been unloaded the cowboys would had some freetime to play volleyball and baseball. They also play table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing to help pass the time. When they have a long trip and a lot of freetime they visit places, like when Luke toured an excavated castle in Crete, and marveled at the Panama Canal on his way to China.

Seagoing Cowboys could go basically anywhere. They went to China, Europe, Greece, and Crete. At the age of 18 Luke could be drafted for military service, but since he was on a cattle-boat trip, they told him he could do that for his service. So if your a Seagoing Cowboy it counts as being in the military service.

My conclusion is being a Seagoing Cowboy can ""open someones eyes"" to the needs of animals. Like Luke said, ""It made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs.""

M-cowboy152,"I think people should participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program because it's a fun and exciting program.

The text states,""The cattle-boat trips were and unbelievable opportunity for a benefiy of seeing Europe and China.""

The text also states,""But seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special, he says.

So was taking a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, a city with streets of water.""

Another reason to join the program is you get to learn a lot of interesting stuff.

The text states,""Luke served as a night watchman.

His job was to check on all the animals every hour.""

The text also states,""But being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more than an adventure for Luke Bomberger.

It opened up the world to him.

One final reason to join the program is because if you like dangerous stuff the program is dangerous.

The text states,""Helping out on his aunt Katie's farm as a boy had prepared Luke for hard work, but not for the dangers at sea.

His job was to check on all the animals every hour.

One rainy night, after making his hourly report to the captain, he slid down a slippery ladder on his backside.

Luke's heart raced as he shot feet first toward an opening on the side of the ship.

A small strip of metal along the edge stopped his slide, keeping him from flying overboard into the dark Atlantic.

He was happy to be alive.

But he couldn't work for a couple of days because of craked ribs.""

Luke got on an boat called SS Charles W. Wooster and there were 335 Horses plus hay and oats to feed the Horses.

M-cowboy160,"Peaple should join this program because you will learn about what the passage is about and write what you think its about. So,Luke was a cowboy that rode over seas. He rode the Pacific Ocean 18 times. No one's ever rode the Pacific 18 times. He started ride the seas in August,1945. When he was heading for greece he was 18 years old.

So,I think he rode the Pacific 18 because that was how old he was turning. But it wasn't that he wanted to ride the seas he rode the seas because World War II in Europe so, I think Europe was is homeland. Luke had found many countries in some ruins. The countries were running out of food supplies so,since Luke was generous he gave them the food supplies they needed even animals. How nice was that of Luke. Luke wanted to help them more so he told them to get in the ship.

Luke was incredible he made nine trips. It took Luke to cross the Pacific two weeks. So,If you times the two weeks it took him to cross and eighteen times he crossed is thirty-six weeks to cross the eighteen times. The ate and drank water but they had to be fed twice a day or three times a day. They played basketball and volleyball. Where the animals were housed there was more games to play like table-tennis but only tournaments,fencing,boxing,reading,wittling,and other games. Being a seagoing cowboy was harder than having a adventure but thats Luke opinion.

Other peaple will have different opinions like adventures are better than being a seagoing cowboy,hating doing both,or not noing what a seagoin cowboy or a adventures does.","

M-cowboy161,"In this passage we see Luke's experience as a Seagoing Cowboy.

Luke shows us how being a Seagoing Cowboy gave him awareness for other people. He also shows us the many impotant things to learn from this job.

First, while being a Seagoing Cowboy Luke learned to take care of many of the animals.

He fed them and gave them water.

These actions, in turn, helped many people that were suffering.

Second, caring for the animals taught Luke to be responsible and to be a hard worker.

In the passage Luke said he had to make sure he fed the animals, give them water every day, and clean the stalls.

He also said ha had to be a night guard and check on the animals every hour to make sure everything was okay.

Next, other than taking care of the animals and doing different work, Luke also got to see new things and have fun.

He said he saw China, Europe, the Acropolis in Greece, an excavated castle in Crete,and the Panama Canal.

He also went on a gondola ride in Venice, Italy.

Even on the boat Luke had fun.

He and the other cowboys played baseball and volleyball games, had tournaments, and did other enjoyable things.

Finally, Luke saw people that were hurting and that needed his help.

Luke said '' I'm grateful for the opportunity,'' and that '' It made me more aware of people...''

Because of the Seagoing Cowboys program, Luke helped many others, even after he was discharged from the program.

The Seagoing Cowboys program was a eye opening adventure for Luke.

It can also be a life changing experience for other people too.

They can learn lessons and help people just like Luke did.

It may also change their outlook on life. They may want to do more to help others in need, rather than just helping themselves.              ","

M-cowboy162,"Would you participate in the Seagoing Cowboys progam? I would so I can visit many places and take adventures. It seems really fun to go to Europ, China, or anywhere else he goes. It just seems really exciting to go journeys and adventures with friends, and explore the outside world.

In the passage it says ""It took about two weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern coast of the United States and a month to get to China."" To me i don't think i would be able to stay on a boat for two weeks and a month its jsut alot of sitting down, and you dont get any rest. Its alot to do when your travling for two weeks and a month.

My argument about Luke's point of view is that it would seem pretty cool to sail and go on journeys with Luke.

He seems like a person who would love people to come along with him on his jouneys and help him explore new things, and keep watch for things, animals, and maybe people. Luke just seems like a very active person who loves people to help him explore.

I think this because he's very very active and he likes to explore. He enjoys his doing what he does if he can travel for more than two weeks. If he can explore and help out . That really shows that he loves his job.         ","

M-cowboy165,"Their are three reasons why Luke's point of view convince people that they should participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program. One reason was that it was an expirience of a life time,he does what he likes to do,and he gets free time to do fun things. Thoes are the reasons why Luke's point of view convinces others to participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program.

I can support this answer that the Seagoing Cowboy's program was an expirience of a life time when the passage says ""but the Seagoing Cowboy was much more than an adventure for Luke Bomberger"".""It opended up a new world for him"". I can also support that it was an exprirence of a life time when the text says,""I'm greatful for this for this opportunity,""he says.""It makes me more aware of people in other contries and their needs.""thats the reason that it was an expirience of a life time.

I can support that he gets to do what he likes to when the texts says that ""Biside helping people ,I had a side benifitt of seeing

Europe and China. I can also support that he likes what hes doing when the text says ""Luke also tored and excavatede Crete and marvoloues at the Panamna Canal on his way to China.""

Your student, John, submitted the following essay and he is talking about the dream of becoming a cowboy:

""[Essay Content: Their are three reasons why Luke's point of view convince people that they should participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program. One reason was that it was an expirience of a life time,he does what he likes to do,and he gets free time to do fun things. Thoes are the reasons why Luke's point of view convinces others to participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program.

I can support this answer that the Seagoing Cowboy's program was an expirience of a life time when the passage says ""but the Seagoing Cowboy was much more than an adventure for Luke Bomberger"".""It opended up a new world for him"". I can also support that it was an exprirence of a life time when the text says,""I'm greatful for this for this opportunity,""he says.""It makes me more aware of people in other contries and their needs.""thats the reason that it was an expirience of a life time.

I can support that he gets to do what he likes to when the texts says that ""Biside helping people ,I had a side benifitt of seeing

Europe and China. I can also support that he likes what hes doing when the text says ""Luke also tored and excavatede Crete and marvoloues at the Panamna Canal on his way to China.""

I can support that found free time to do fun thing when the text says the cow boys played baseball and volleyball table tennis and more fun things. They also boxed read whiting and more those are the reasons how he got to do fun things

In conclusion he did alot of things to inspire people to be a Seagoing Cow boy. If mre people were like hime the world would be a better place. ]""

M-cowboy166,"Luke has crossed on the atlantic ocean 16 times. It took him about two weeks to get there and back. He took care of the anmials on the crossing so that kept him busy most of the time. There is good things that happend and some bad things that happen with becoming a seagoing cowboy.

First, you need to be trained if u are not trained then why would you even go in the first place. You need to stay fit, u need to be able to survie with out food incase you run out or run out of water. Helping out on his aunts farm helped him get in shape and prepared for a real adventure. On his seconed trip he was the night watchman . That does not take so much hardwork but staying up is the key. He had to check on the animals every hour, and then tell about his hourly report. But he could not work for a while because he broke one of his ribs.

Next, he did not just go to help people even know that was his main priorty. he also went to see all thease beaituful places the would have been arriving to.

Then, they would still have fun on board it is not as bad as u think. You still get to play baseball and volleyball games where all the animals had been staying will they were on board. They played thease games to pass time, table - tennis tourmants, fencing, boxing, reading, and whittling.

last, of all the cattle boat trips, were unbelievable opportiny for a small - town boy he says. Beside helping people getting to travel areound the world it was just brethtaking. Most of his trips were a susses I enjoyed the trips and can't wait for more.

To sum up my thoughts, I think he should go u still get fun out of this trip it is not like you have to work all day and night. He endeded up going and he had a great time. He said in this passage it opended up a whole new world for me. From day one crossing the atlantice ocean. I new right then and there this was a oppurtuntiy of a life time.  ","

M-cowboy169,"Luke Bomberger works at two jobs and has a busy life style. He works at the grocery store and at the bank. Don, his friend asked if he wanted to go to Europe on a cattle boat. Luke didn't know what to say, because it was an opportunity of a life time. So he decided to go, they were to go overseas to take care of horses, young cows, and mules. In 1945 they recieved there orders to New Orleans and they arrived August 14, 1945. Eventually, they headed to Greece with 335 horses also with eniugh hay and oats to feed them. Luke turned the age 18 before arriving to greece which meant he could be ready to participate for military service. When they learned he was on a cattle boat they told me to keep doing what I was doing. Luke had made 9 trips, more than any Seagoing Cowboy ever. It was an amazing opportunity for Luke, he loved visiting ancient things. Luke didn't just have to me stuck in a boat with horses he got to also go out and adventure. It took 2 weeks to cross the Alantic Ocean, from the eastern coast of the United States. Also another month to get china, this seems like hard work. But the animals kept Luke busy, they had t be fed and watered two or three times a day. Bales of hay had to be pulled from ship to feed them. Luke had some experience by helping on Katies farm as a boy. On lukes second trip at a Seagoing Cowboy, he was to be night watchman his had to check on the animals every hour. A rainy night he had to go down a ladder, his feet slipped then a small trip of metal caught him from tumbling of the boat. He was happy to be alive, even with a few cracked ribs so he couldnt work for a couple days. Luke always had fun on board though. He got to play games which would make time go faster. Games such as volleyball, baseball, tennis and more. Being a Seagoing cowboy wasnt just an adventure he had fun to and the world open up to him. It made him aware of many opportunities. As you can tell Luke has a busy life with everything going on but he enjoys being a part of many things. Luke is glad his friend Don let him go on this trip.","

M-cowboy172,"Have you ever wanted to help people during war without joining the military well you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program. The Seagoing Cowboys program is where you get on a boat with other people and go to far places to get animals.

The Seagoing Cowboys program is a good way to help other country so there country's people can survive after war and other causes. On the Seagoing Cowboys program you can meet new people, and see new places and structures. You can also take animals from one country to another to give one country animals so they can make food so they all don't starve. You can also help make peoples lives better after war and acomplish great things. Just like Luke Bomberger who was just a average town boy then he joined the Seagoing Cowboys program because his friend then he became a hero.

The Seagoing Cowboys program was created by the UNRRA (the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration). The UNRRA was created during World War 2 in 1945 to help country's effected by World War 2 by destruction. The UNRRA helps by getting soldiers to help fight. They also search for food and animals. The Seagoing Cowboys program helps by getting horses,young cows, and mules. The Seagoing Cowboys program headed to Greece with a cargo of 335 and enough hay and oats to feed them.

Joining the Seagoing Cowboy is a good idea if you want to help country's just like Luke Bombberger did by brining animals you can see different places and meet new people.","

""[Essay Content: Have you ever wanted to help people during war without joining the military well you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program. The Seagoing Cowboys program is where you get on a boat with other people and go to far places to get animals.

The Seagoing Cowboys program is a good way to help other country so there country's people can survive after war and other causes. On the Seagoing Cowboys program you can meet new people, and see new places and structures. You can also take animals from one country to another to give one country animals so they can make food so they all don't starve. You can also help make peoples lives better after war and acomplish great things. Just like Luke Bomberger who was just a average town boy then he joined the Seagoing Cowboys program because his friend then he became a hero.

The Seagoing Cowboys program was created by the UNRRA (the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration). The UNRRA was created during World War 2 in 1945 to help country's effected by World War 2 by destruction. The UNRRA helps by getting soldiers to help fight. They also search for food and animals. The Seagoing Cowboys program helps by getting horses,young cows, and mules. The Seagoing Cowboys program headed to Greece with a cargo of 335 and enough hay and oats to feed them.

Joining the Seagoing Cowboy is a good idea if you want to help country's just like Luke Bombberger did by brining animals you can see different places and meet new people.]""

Luke plays games on the ships during the trip with the other cowboys. Luke and his friends can play too. Luke and the cowboys played things games like baseball, volleyball, table tennis, fencing, boxing,reading, and more. Luke just doesnt get to have fun, but he does get to explore things during his trips like getting the chance to visist oher countries. Lukes job is pretty fun although it can be very dangerous. Luke has to stay up through the night sometimes no matter what the weather is and watch and take care of all of the animals on board. That part doesnt seem so dangerous does it? The dangerous part is being careful of where you go and where you step. One night luke was on the ship taking care of the animals and accidentaly slipped and almsot slid off the ship and fell in to the dark, deep Atlantic ocean. He was very happy to still be alive, but he still broke his ribs and couldnt work for a while.

First,you should join this because you get to help peolpe in need. Luke helped people after World War II was over in Europe recover their food supplies, animals,and much more. Another way that he helped is he took care of people's horses,young cows,and mules that were shipped overseas by himself.

Secondly, you can experience new things. Luke first took care of the animals on a ship and after that he was a night watchman. On the boat he got to play baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where animals had been housed with the cowboys. He also got to do table-tennis tournaments, boxing, fencing, reading, whittling, and other games.

Lastly,you an visit tourist sites. Luke got to visit an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on his way to China. He also got to take a gondola ride in Venice,Italy. Lastly,on his way he got to see the Acropolis in Greece.

Now you can see why you should join the Seagoing Cowboys. From helping people in need, experiencing new things, to visiting tourist sites. Now you know what program you can join after hgih school, in the future.","

M-cowboy180,"The reasons of joing the program is first you got to be a great swimer if your on the ocean. Another reasons is you got to be scared of nothing or brave. Also you have to be tough. Beause in A Cowboy Who Rode The Waves luck creaked his ribs beacuse he have to check on some animals and then he fell and he thought he was going overboard but metal stopped him and he was happy to be alive. If you love to travle and be on the sea then this is a perfect job for you. On the job you go to new plarts of the world.

why you shouldn't join is because you might fall overboard and noone might noice that you fell. Or the ship might fail at working and sink and you might not have a boat incase that might happen. What if the ship gets hit and you all start to sink.

Luke said being a cowboy is much more than a adverture for Luke Bombeger. Also being a cowboy opened the world to him and he is greatful for that opportunity of being a cowboy. He also said it make him more aware of people in countries and their needs. When they return home they play game that help them pass the time like baseball,volleyball,table-tennis,fencing,boxing,and reading.","

M-cowboy181,"Luke encourages people to join the seagoing cowboys program because he thinks since when he were in the program it was amazing I know this because in paragraph 5 it says the cattle-boat trips were unbeliveible opportunity for a small town boy.

Also it says But seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special so was taking a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, a city with streets of water. I think he thinks that the places they go are really special because each one of the Countries has different things about that country. Maybe one country might be more poor than the other but he is impress how they are manaing to keep their selves together and not fall apart.

Another reason I think Luke trys to convince people to join this program is so they can learn and change the way they used to be. The program can teach them alot I know this because in paragraph 7 it says Helping out on his aunt katie's farm as a boy had prepared luke for hard work, but not for dangers at the sea. Thats teaching him how to survive on his own he's getting taught and he is changing during this program so thats what he thinks this pro gram can do for other kids wanting to do this program.

Luke trys to tell you all the things you can be instead of the things you think you have to be. Before Luke was in this program he worked at a grocery store and as a banker I know this because in paragraph 1 it says Luke Bomberger had no idea that hi life could change soon after his high school graduation. he was working part time jobs in a grocery store and a bank when his friend Don invited him to go to Europe on a cattle boat so that why I think he trys to encourage people to join the program.

If your answer is yes we would like you to come and sign up for The United Relief and Rehabilitation Adminstration. Its for SEagoing Cowboys that are willing to take care of horses, youngcows, and mules that are shipped overseas.

When you go through the proccess of going on the trip, don't get nervous. Luke Bomberger was a confident man to go on his journey with his best friend and was never really afraid. Every time you ride on that boat you feel more a live, which is a good thing. All you have to do is believe in yourself and you can do anything! Taking care of animals is another thing to, if you absolutely love animals than of course you might want to join. Especially if you are a farmer boy.

Going on the journey made Luke feel alive, and it should make you feel alive if you think you are going to join the club that takes you overseas. I know all the men loved to go on that trip to take care of many farm animals, especially if you do that your everyday life. When Luke was on that trip he loved it, he first(1st) went to New Orleans for the trip. They got there the day the Pacific war ended , on August 14th. On his first (1st) trip the crew he was with ended up with 335 horses on the cargo, and had enough to feed everyone including the men on the ship.

The story of Luke Bomberger is probably not urging you yet, but when Luke was official 18 he knew that he could join military. Then he thought I still love seagoing trips, so I'm going to stick with it so he did. Do you see how motivated Luke was to join the Club of UNRRA. Luke already taken a total of nine(9) trips and he was proud of it. Luke couldnt imagine his life without the trips he wouldn't have gone on so he stayed on going with it and he was confident in his choice.

Not just that but Luke got to visit other countries such as China and European countries, such as Venice, Italy. He also got to help people all over the world. He was so proud of what he did and so full of joy. Luke oncer got hurt on one (1) of his journeys. While Luke was checking on the anoimals on a very rainy night he slipped and fell but luckly there was a small piece of metal that protected Luke from flying off the deck into the Atlantic Ocean, but thanks to that small piece of metal he was saved.

So ask yourself do you want to join the UNRRA club(united Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Adminstration). If you do make sure on your descions that you want to do it. Anything is possible for anyone! If it was possible for Luke Bomberger than its possible for you! So sign up now if you want to be a success like Luke Bomberger!

M-cowboy185,"In a Cowboy who Rode the waves , the author talks about the Seagoing Cowboys program. Not only does this program help victims , but it can save many cities that would soon start a war. Luke went over the Atlantic Ocean 16 times to help WW2 victims and help their community grow and rebuild their city. There are more than 1,000 victims in each world war that happens and just imagine how many animals were killed too.

One way you could join the Seagoing Cowboys would be to simply sign up for it, since Luke claims that he just signed up ,as stated in the text. You could also join the UNRRA and get the opportunity to get to choose every branch that could help victims in need. Even though Luke signed up to help the Cattle boat, he got to go sight seeing in China, Acroppolis , Venis,Italy and the Panama Canal.

Out of all of the time, Luke was on the Cattle boat , but in the text it states that he did the same things on his Aunts farm, but did not help him at sea. One day a bad storm hit and he landed by the animal pens and landed on a pice of metal , he could not work for a few days because of his broken ribs. He was happy to be alive but when the animals were shipped the crew would play lots of fun games. He had done this 9 times to and from where they were getting dropped off at. Also, he crossed the Atlantic Ocean 16 times.

After doing this job he helped get awareness of everything and why other people needed to join . He helped most victims with getting a new home and rebuilding their city. Luke enjoyed doing this job and loved playing with the crew after the animals were loaded. For Luke this was more than a job. After all he had to have a little adventure , right?

In conclusion , Luke loved his job. It was as it was all an adventure. The text states that it opened a new world to him. After that he raised more awareness. All i know is that he will , Survive !","

Cowboy because he knew it was an opportunity of a lifetime, as he says in paragraph one. Luke also wanted to help others who had been affected by World War ll.

Luke crossed the Atlantic Ocean sixteen times and the Pacific Ocean twice, to help countries recover their food supplies, animals, and much more as it says in paragraph two. Even though it was a long journey across the oceans and the waters were rough Luke loved being a Seagoing Cowboy and he loved to help the people.

Some people would probably refuse to go to another country that had just been through war some people would say it was to risky and unsafe well it is, some people might say that it is too dangerous to cross the ocean well it is but Luke felt that these were things that he needed to do and is something that is important to him.

Luke also got to visit many great places in between his journeys, he got to see many different places such as the Panama Canal on his way to China in paragraph five Luke says that ""seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special"" and ""so was taking a gondola ride in Venice , Italy a city with streets of water. Luke thought that it was all so great.

But some people might say that they wouldnt go there because once again it's just too dangerous or that if they wanted to go there then they definetly not go on a boat and they would much more want to fly there. Well once again that is their opinion and Luke was happy the way that he went and was happy that he could see it and that he go to experience the jouney.

In conclusion Luke loves being a Seagoing Cowboy he loves all the sights, all the help that he can give to these other people, and that he could have this opportunity in life.                  ","

Luke also got to visit many great places in between his journeys, he got to see many different places such as the Panama Canal on his way to China in paragraph five Luke says that ""seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special"" and ""so was taking a gondola ride in Venice , Italy a city with streets of water. Luke thought that it was all so great.

But some people might say that they wouldnt go there because once again it's just too dangerous or that if they wanted to go there then they definetly not go on a boat and they would much more want to fly there. Well once again that is their opinion and Luke was happy the way that he went and was happy that he could see it and that he go to experience the jouney.

In conclusion Luke loves being a Seagoing Cowboy he loves all the sights, all the help that he can give to these other people, and that he could have this opportunity in life.                  ]""

While reading the text it states that Lukes life has changed by joining the Seagoing Cowboys program. He helped people beacause the affect of World war II. The text states that, During the war it wasn't alot of food, water, most of the shelters was not sturdy. Thats when Don signed up.

When Luke turned 18 he had finally arrive to itally, that means he can aslo get drafted by the military. While in the military he had made 9 trips in the course of 9 years.He had helped alot of people during this process. He went to china and the great wall of china and helepd during that process of people starving being hedydrated and alot more.

While on the ship he had to feed all of the animals. Clean up for them. Water all of the plants,and make sure all the bales of hay and bags of oats are still good. On the second night he was on night patrol. he had to guard the ship and make sure the coast guard knew who he was.

M-cowboy189,"You should really join the Seagoing Cowboys because they have lots of fun even though it might seem scary to be on a boat with horses then yes but it is actually pretty safe. Luke may have broke a few ribs and other stuff but he had fun and if you live on a farm then you would be good for it because you have to clean out stalls and feed them and put out bals of hay for them to munch on. You could be on the next boat to be a Seagoing Cowboy of Cowgirl. You may have to do night patroll but it don't matter as long as youhave fun. Maybe even bring a friend so you don't feel so lonely if you don't know anyone.

If you don't like boats then don't do it if you like boats and horses then your the one to apply and we will send you a ticket to get on the boat and be on your way. If you want to see the world or some parts of it then sign up and come join us because we go everywhere you can imagine like China, New Zealand, and Crete. These are just a few of the places that we go to so the horses can get where they need to be. We will go way across the world just to deliver horses.

Luke had no friends when he came other than the friend that asked him to go with him to be a Seagoing Cowboy. Luke made many new friends on the boat. He made 9 (nine) trips all together from that whole career that he had with that job. He had fun and learned new things about boats and horses.

He thought it was going to be a chance of a life time but he changed his mind it being completely amazing better than what he thought it would be for someone like him. His journeys were amazing and he loved it and his family was very proud of him and his friend. He said he is grateful for the opportunity. He also said it made him more aware of people of other countries and there needs. The awareness stayed with him and it lead his family to host many of international students and exchange visiters and students for many years.

This is Lukes story and this is why you should join. ","

In the middle of the story people realized that people, animals, and more looked dried out, so 44 nations had joined to form UNRRA and hired ""Seagoing Cowboys.""Luke and Don had signed up for it, knowing that they were going to help animals. When they had arrived from taking the animals to New Orleans the day the Pacific War had ended. They had 335 horses plus enough oats and hay to feed them. Luke had recently turned 18 before arriving to Greece. He had made 9 trips before being discharged.

I think that thanks to Don, Luke had gotten a great job just for him. I also think that Luke enjoyed the buisness he was in and what he was doing. Don is very encouraging, helpful, nice, and thanks to all of that he had gotten his friend,Luke, a job. Luke had later began helping his auntie on the farm and it prepared him for hard work.

M-cowboy191,"Have you ever tried becoming a seagoing cowboy? If not, I suggest that you consider joining the program. The job of a seagoing cowboy is to take care of horses, young cows, and mules which are sent overseas to people that need them. While being in the Seagoing Cowboy program, there are many positive things such as being able to experience adventures, visiting many unique places, and having the opportunity to help people in need.

A Seagoing Cowboy is able to experience many adventures. When Luke was a seagoing cowboy, he had the chance of experiencing a storm while at sea. Think about how exciting and adventurous that would be! Also Luke says that he found time to have fun on board, especially once all the animals were taken care of or unloaded. The cowbobys would then play baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds, or set up different sporting tournements. Experiencing a storm at sea and playing many fun games on board are just two examples of the many adventures that could take place as a seagoing cowboy.

If you are a seagoing cowboy, you not only have adventures but you also can see and visit many unique places that an average person wouldn't have the opportunity to see or experience. In Luke's nine years as a seagoing cowboy, he was able to see and experience some pretty interesting things in Europe and China. He specifically saw the Acropolis in Greece, and thought that that experience was very special. On top of seeing the Acropolis, he also was able to take a gondola ride in Venice, Italy. There would also be many more places to go and people to see.

The main reason for becoming a seagoing cowboy would be to help people in need. Luke specifically helped people affected by World War II. The people affected by World War II needed food, clothing, animals, and more. Luke helped with the animals. Luke states that he was very grateful for the opportunity of becoming a seagoing cowboy so he could help people in need. He says that it made him ""more aware of people of other countries and their needs.""

Becoming a seagoing cowboy is a great experience and very beneficial. Luke says, ""the cattle-boat trips were an unbelievable opportunity for a small-town boy."" ","

M-cowboy197,"Luke Bomberger crossed the Atlantic Ocean 16 times and the Pacific Ocean twice to help people affected by Word War ll. In this passage there is a lot of good things and bad things about being Seagoing Cowboy, like what fears you have to overcome,what jobs you do, and how long you have to do it and what kind of fun they have.

To begin with,you have to be very brave to become a Seagoing Cowboy.

To become a Seagoing Cowboy you can't be scared of water or being on a boat for a long time. One day when Luke was on night watchman it was very rainy.

When he was going to make his hourly report to his captin he fell on a slippery ladder and cracked his ribs.

Next, is what jobs you do to become a Seagoing Cowboy. If you are a Seagoing Cowboy you have help a lot of people and animals.

On the way across the Atlantic Ocean, Luke's boat picked up some animals. Luke was incharge of feeding them and give them water 2 to 3 times a day. Also he had to clean up after the animals.

Last, is how long you have to be on the ship and what fun you can have.

When Luke had to cross the Atlantic Ocean it took his ship 2 weeks to get across. After the animals got unloaded, the other Seagoing Cowboys got to have some fun. The cowboys played baseball and volleyball games where the animals had been housed.

Tabel-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and games also helped pass time.

To sum up my thoughts, being a Seagoing Cowboy isn't that bad.

In the passage there is a lot of good and bad things about Seagoing Cowboys in the fears you have to overcome, how long you have to do it and the fun you can have, and the jobs you have to do. In the future, I hope we can have more people become Seagoing Cowboys.      ","

M-cowboy198,"Why do you think Don Reist want Luke Bomberger to join the Seagoing Cowboys program ? Well , i think he wants him to join the Seagoing cowboys program because he probably really like it , and want his friend to join .

One reason i think Luke joined because like he say , he think it would be an opportunity of a lifetime . in the passage it states UNRRA hires seagoing cowboys to take care of horses , young cows , and mules that were shipped overseas , Luke and Don signed up . The passage also states in August 1945 , they recieved their orders to report to New Orleans . They arrived August 14 which was the day pacific war ended .

Another reason i think Luke wanted to join , because his friend was their and he wanted to be with his friend , and do what he are doing now . The passage states when Luke's draft board learned that he was on a cattle boat , they told him to just keep doing that for his service . The passage also states Luke turned 18 before arriving in greece , which meant he could be drafted in military service .

The whole thing to the paragraphs and all the supporting details is that Don wanted Luke to be like him and asked him to sign up so they could be with eachother . They wanted to have good opportunities with eachother t, they wanted to grow up and become something just from being stated in the seagoing cowboy program . Like they say in the story at 18 before arriving in Greece you could be drafted in military . That right there means they wanted to be something like a star that everyone wants to meat or be important or be famous , because lots of times it gets boring sitting around all the time . They said "" hey lets get up and go sign up for something to become something together since we are close friends . ""            ","

M-cowboy199,"Luke's claim was that when his friend Don invited him to a trip to Europe on a cattle boat and Luke knew right away he had to say yes because it was a once

in a lifetime opportunity. Also that he got to travel and exploer many diffrent

places! Another one of Lukes claim was that he was greatful for the opportunity he got to have by being a seagoing cowboy.

A few reasons to join the club it that you get to go places you probobly never been before. Also that you get to travel all over the world and explore diffrent places and see many diffrent things from many diffrent paces, just like Luke!

It may have taken him two weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern coast of the United States and a month to get to china but, it may have been worth it because Luke got to see many diffrent things and explore unique stuff! Luke would normally be caring for the animals and so it kept him busy for a long time.The cowboys played baseball and volleyball games so, if you like those games you might want to join them! Being a seagoing cowboy was much more fun than an adventure, it opened the world to Luke. Luke said he was greatful for the opportunity.

"" I had the side benifit of seeing Europe and China. "" That is what Luke said because he enjoyed being a seagoing cowboy and going on all the adventures that Luke got to do! Maybe one day if you become a seagoing cowboy you will be able to adventure all the things Luke got to do. There may

be some rough time like what Luke had when he couldn't work for a few days, for an example,

when he was a watchman and it was a rainy night Luke sliped

and fell and he had a few broken ribs but he was saved by a small strip of metal

along the edge so it stopped Luke from sliding. Luke aws happy to be alive

though! Luckly for Luke he recovered in a few days. Luke was happy to be a cowboy and you might too!

M-cowboy200,"Do you know what a Seagoing Cowboy is, After world war two was over many countries were left in ruin, so the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration UNRRA sent the ruined countries cows,horses and mules. The Seagoing Cowboys job was to take care of the animals that were shipped overseas. Luke Bomberger was a seagoing Cowboy who made eighteen trips as a seagoing Cowboy. I think that Luke Bomberg would want others to join the seagoing cowboys because, It could make you more aware of other countries, it is also fun and you get to experience other cultures.

I think that Luke Bomberg would want you to join the Seagoing Cowboys because you get the oppertunity to go to other countries and experience them. In the text it says ""Besides helping I had the benefit of seeing Europe and China."" the text says that because of the Seagoing Cowboy job he had he was able to experience other cultures and countries.

Another reason I think that Luk Bomberg would want you to join the Seagoing Cowboys is because it makes you more aware of other countries. In the text it says "" It made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs."" If Luke Bomberg had not become a Seagoing Cowboy he would not have realized the needs of other countries and their people.

I also think that Luke Bomberg would want you to become a Seagoing Cowboy is because it can be fun. in the text it says "" The cowboys played baseball and volley ball in the empty holds where animals had been."" Once the animals were taken off of the boat the cowboys were able to play games and have fun.

What would you do, would you become a Seagoing Cowboy? Think of all the benefits like the sightseeing, the fun and the growth of your awareness of all the other people in the world.","

""[Essay Content: Do you know what a Seagoing Cowboy is, After world war two was over many countries were left in ruin, so the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration UNRRA sent the ruined countries cows,horses and mules. The Seagoing Cowboys job was to take care of the animals that were shipped overseas. Luke Bomberger was a seagoing Cowboy who made eighteen trips as a seagoing Cowboy. I think that Luke Bomberg would want others to join the seagoing cowboys because, It could make you more aware of other countries, it is also fun and you get to experience other cultures.

I think that Luke Bomberg would want you to join the Seagoing Cowboys because you get the oppertunity to go to other countries and experience them. In the text it says ""Besides helping I had the benefit of seeing Europe and China."" the text says that because of the Seagoing Cowboy job he had he was able to experience other cultures and countries.

Another reason I think that Luk Bomberg would want you to join the Seagoing Cowboys is because it makes you more aware of other countries. In the text it says "" It made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs."" If Luke Bomberg had not become a Seagoing Cowboy he would not have realized the needs of other countries and their people.

I also think that Luke Bomberg would want you to become a Seagoing Cowboy is because it can be fun. in the text it says "" The cowboys played baseball and volley ball in the empty holds where animals had been."" Once the animals were taken off of the boat the cowboys were able to play games and have fun.

What would you do, would you become a Seagoing Cowboy? Think of all the benefits like the sightseeing, the fun and the growth of your awareness of all the other people in the world.]""

M-cowboy204,"Do you know what a seagoing cowboy is? Luke Bomberger was a ''seagoing cowboy'',a person who helped foreign countries of sea's after WWII. Luke was apart of the UNRRA, (the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration)to help foreign country's who have been left in ruins get back on their feet. On his way to Europe,he had to cross the large and vast Atlantic Ocean.

To pass time on there way to Europe they played games such as,Table-Tennis,fencing,and boxing. They also read and whittled to pass time. The way Luke got into the seagoing cowboy business,was his friend asked him if he wanted to join him,and he couldn't pass up this surreal oppurtunity. But, the downside was he he had to travel the rambunctious sea's. The ship Luke and Don boarded to take these cattle over to Europe is the SS Charles W. Wooster.

Reasons join this program are that you get to help others get back on their feet in times of disaster such as war,hurricane,tsunami,nuclear disaster,or other types of disasters that may happen. But their also some dangers to be aware of. During one of Luke's journey's to Europe he slid down a slippery ladder on his backside. If it weren't for a small strip of metal he would have fallen into the dark Atlantic Ocean. But,besides broken ribs he was glad he wasn't sleeping with the fishes,literally!

It's also an adventure to. During another one of his trips he got to boat around the watery ""streets"" of Venice,Italy in a gondola. Also while in Greece he visited a excavated castle. He also marveled the Panama Canal on his way to

China. But,what came most in handy is that he used to help his Aunt Katie on her farm as a boy so, Luke was prepared for the hard work.

So as a conclusion to this story, I would hope you join an organization that helps others in need, especially countries overseas. Even though this job might be hard, your making a difference in our world and there's. You could join an orginization like UNRRA,or just simply join and orginization that helps new Americans,like immigrants from foreign countries fit in in our society today in America. That would be a good example our country could set for other countries. This should be our goal for every thing and anything. Are goal should be to help others and just not ourselves. We need to stop being selfish and help other's get back on there feet if their in times of need. This is the example we should set as The United States of America.","

M-cowboy206,"Being a Seagoing Cowboy is much more than just taking care of the animals and cleaning the stalls for the animals.

Doing this, it could open up your eyes to a new world and explore new places.

Luke though it was an opportunity of a lifetime.

The cattle-boat trips were an unbelievable opportunity for a small-town boy, he says. Besides helping people, I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China. But seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special, he says. So was taking a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, a city with streets of water.

The fact that Luke thought helping all of those people in need, shows you that he wanted to help them.

But, not only was he taking care of the people and helping them, he was also helping the animals. I think he also liked taking care of the animals himself.

When people think of a Cowboy, they see someone wearing cowboy boots and riding a horse.

They also see a farm with a whole bunch of animals.

If someone is a cowboy, they normally like animals and taking care of them.

Like also liked the trips coming back. They played baseball and volleyball games in the empty stalls where animals had been. Table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and other games that also helped pass the time.

You also got to visit unique places.

Luke got to go to Greece, China, and even toured an excavated castle in Crete.

He also marveled at the Panama Canal, during his trip to China.

Since Luke didn't just go once, he must have enjoyed going on the trips and helping people.

I like that Luke had aggread to go on the trip and that he is engoing it after he broke his ribs because that means he has a good spirit. I did injoy this story and people shuld participate in the program.

Luke's participation in the progran hays allowed him to experince adventures and visits to many unique places. Such as when he saw the Acropolis in greesce was special. He also saw Europe and China. There took about two weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern coast of the United States and a month to get to China. Luke also saw Italy with streets of water. He is a lucky person to see those great places.

His experience with the program had opened up the world to him and he has experience some exiting events. As seen in paragraph 9 it says '', It opend up the world to him"". It also says ''it made me more aware of people of other cuntries and there needs"". I like that Luke had aggread to go on the trip and that he is engoing it after he broke his ribs because that means he has a good spirit. I did injoy this story and people shuld participate in the program.

Luke's participation in the progran hays allowed him to experince adventures and visits to many unique places. Such as when he saw the Acropolis in greesce was special. He also saw Europe and China. There took about two weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern coast of the United States and a month to get to China. Luke also saw Italy with streets of water. He is a lucky person to see those great places.

Luke is likes the program good all its good things. So i whould go and other people shuld to.         ]""

M-cowboy208,"""Hmmmm, i think it would be great to have others in the Seagoing Cowboys program."" Luke Bomberger is apart of the Seagoing Cowboys program and thinks it would be great if new faces would join the program as well. So Luke is thinking about how he'd get the message out to people so they could probably be in the program. ''I should talk to the others and see what they think."" Luke said, so he spreads the word to the other guys and they all think it's a great idea. Luke was amazed everyone was wanting others to join the program also. All of a sudden luke thought to himself ''We'll be getting back on board in three more days. So he told the guys that they need to get the word out to as many people as they could instantainiously. So they thought of a plan then one of the guys blurted out and said, 'since were on land right now we could probably find a radio station around here."" So the other guys gave him a high five and telling him that's an brilliant idea. So the guys took a map and started roaming around seeing if they could find a radio station. And about two hours later of searching they finally found a little radio station in the middle of no where. So Luke lead the the group of gentlemen in the little radio station and spoted an old man drinking coffe just sitting there. So as soon as Luke said 'Excuse me sir?.'' The old man jumped up instantainioulsy and said, 'AHHH! who are you and what do you want?"". So all the gentlemen introduced theirselfs and told the old man how trhey needed to let others know about their program and how they needed his help. So the old man responded with, ""What's in it for me?"" the gentlemen thought for a moment and one said, 'Oh i know, if you let us use your thingy majigger here you can leave this boring job and come with us."" So the old man thought for a moment and then said ""Deal"". So the old man turned on his machine to have all the guys on the radio then he counted down ""3...2...1...and action."" So Luke spoke first and said ''Gentlemen and gentlemen come one come all to be apart of the Seagoing Cowboys program."" then he gave out all the infomation then in less in two minutes the radio station started to get dozens of phone calls and all the men that called were excepted and flew out to where all the other men were. Three day later it was time to take off and get ready to start sailing so Lucas did a head count. The program started out with 24 members but when Lucas was done counting the program had 148 members in all. Lucas was happy with the success and progress that was made, so everyone got settled in and started to sail.","

Would you like to be part of the Seagoing Cowboys program? If you don't, I am going to tell you about a text I read about a man. In this text, it says that a man named Luke Bomberger was working two part-time jobs in a grocery store and a bank when his friend Don Reist invited him to go to Europe on a cattle boat. Luke couldn't say no. He knew it was an oppurtunity of a lifetime.

It was 1945, World War II was over in Europe, and many countries were left in ruins. To help these countries recover their food supplies, animals, and more, 44 nations joined together to form UNRRA, a relief and rehabilitation administration. UNRRA hired ''Seagoing Cowboys'' to take care of the horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas. Luke and his friend Don signed up for the Seagoing Cowboys program. In the text it also says that Luke went on cattle-boat trips. He also got to go to many places across the country. He also found time to have fun on board, ecspecially on return trips after the animals had been unloaded.

The cowboys played baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where animals had been housed. But being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more than an adventure for Luke Bomberger. It opened up the world to him. ""I'm grateful for the opportunity,"" he says. ""It made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs."" That oppotunity of a lifetime is good to have because you could experience adventures you have never experienced before, and that is why you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program.

Luke also toured an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on his way to China.

It is not all just fun and games for Luke. It took about two weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern coast of the United States and a month to get to China. Caring for the animals during the crossings kept Luke busy.

They had to be fed and watered two or three times a day. Bales of hay and bags of oats had to be pulled up from the lower holds of the ship. Stalls had to be cleaned.

Helping out his aunt Katie's farm as a boy had prepared Luke for hard work, but not for the dangers at sea. On his second tripLuke served as night watchman. His job was to check on all the animals every hour. One rainy night, After making his hourly report to the captain, he slid down a slippery ladder on his backside. Luke's heart raced as he shot feet first towardan opening on the side of the ship. A small strip of metal along the edge stopped his slide, keeping him from flying overboard into the dark Atlantic. He was happyto be alive. But he couldn't work a couple of days because of cracked ribs.

But being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more than an adventure for Luke Bomberger. It opened up the world to him. ""I'm grateful the opportunity.""

You should join the Seagoing Cowboys program because you would be to help countries recover from war, recover their food supplies, animals, and more. The UNRRA which is the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation hired ""Seagoing Cowboys"" to take care of the horses, young cows, and mules that were being shipped over sea. This is what you would be doing if you joined the Seagoing Cowboys.

While Luke was in the program called Seagoing Cowboys he experienced many amazing sights. He experienced many sights, has been to places,and done many things like go to

Europe, China, Acropolis in Greece, and took a gondola ride in Vience, Italy. He also toured an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on his way to China.

M-cowboy217,"The Seagoing Cowboy Heros

Do you like going to new places around the world? Would you like to join the Seagoing Cowboys program? If you would, then go to China. The Seagoing Cowboys program is a program to take care of the horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas. Luke Bomberger crossed the Atlantic Ocean 16 times and the Pacific Ocean twice to help people affected bt World War 2.

Luke Bomberger had no idea that his life would change soon after his high school graduation. He was working two part-time jobs in a grocery store and a bank when his friend Don Reist invited him to go to Europe on a cattle boat. Luke couldn't say no. He know it was an opportunity of a lifetime. He had to go. It was 1945, World War 2 was over in Europe, and many countries were left in ruins. To help these countries recovert their food supplies, animals, and more, 44 nations joined together to form UNRRA (the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration). UNRRA hired ""Seagoing Cowboys"" to take care of the animals that were shipped overseas. Luke and Don signed up.

Here are some reasons you should join Seagoing Cowboys program. The first reason is that you could travel around the world if you like to travel. The second reson is that you would get to take care of animals, such as cow, horses, and even mules! How cool is that. The third reason is that you can play games!

The cowboys played baseeball and volleyball games in the empty holds where animals had been housed. Table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing,reading,whittling, and games also helped pass the time. But being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more than an adventure for Luke Bomberger. It opened up the worlkd to him. ""Im grateful for the opportunity,"" he says. ""It made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs."" And that awareness styaed with him, leading his family to host a number of international students and exchange visitors for many years. So, after i gave you reasons and supported my answer with details, would you want to go to Seagoing Cowboys program?? ","

So Luke and Don signed up.

In August 1945,they received an order to go to New Orleans. They arrived on the 14th of August the day the pacific war ended says Luke. They got there papers and got a boat called the SS Charles W. Wooster and headed towards Greece. They were delivering 335 horses and enough hay and oats to feed them. Be for they got to Greece Luke turned 18 years old. That ment that he could be drafed at any time to go to war. When he told them that he was on a cattle-boatr trip they told him to do it for the Military Service. Luke had made nine trips that more then any seagoing cow boy has ever made.

The cattle boat trip was an alsome trip for a small town boy Luke say. besides helping people he also got to see different countries like all of Europe and China but when he saw Acropolis in Greece it was special to him Luke says. It toke Luke and Don abount two weeks to crose the Atlantic ocean from the eastern coast that is a long time on water non stop that would make me sick and never ride a boat again but sometimes you have to do things you dont want to do.

When Luke was little he helped his aunt Katie's farm ou when he was a boy and he has worked hard ever since that is my dream is to work on a farm. It did not teach him the dangers of the sea though. When he was on his secened trip he was a night watchman. He had to check on all of the animals every hour and that was easy i bet because of him helping on a farm when he was a kid that was the same but it was on a boat. When he was reporting to the captin one time he slipoed and fell on the ground and a peice of meatal stop him from going over board.

So that was my eassy on Luke and his life I really liked this story alot i would have wrote more but i am about out of time so thats all i got. I found out that that peice of meatal craked his ribs so he could not work for a acouple of days witch that might of hert his body every day till it was helled but i do nt know because i am not Luke and that is the end of my story.

Another one of Luke's reason you shouls join the Seagoing Cowboys program is helping the animals.

Luke had to haul bales of hay and bags of oats from the lower holds of the ships. Luke also had the job of checking up on the animals at night every hour.

M-cowboy220,They should do the program because in the program you will learn how to be a cowboy. Also you will learn how to travel the seas and survive in cold wheather. So being in the program could be fun because you will learn how to be a cowboy. Luke wants to be a segoing cowboy because he likes to travel the seas and he also likes to be a cowboy. Another reason is because he wants to have fun as a cowboy and he really wants to go travel the seas. He wants to have fun because he never has fun at his house so that is why he wants to have some fun. His house is probably boring so that is also why he wants to go outside and have some fun at the program because he wants to get out of his house and have fun. He wants to go outside and do the program so he can be a cowboy and have fun. To train to be a cowboy you have go through obstacles and overcome your fears so you can travel the seas. You also want to be able to ride the waves so you be brave and save people from your enemies. You also defenitely need to be strong so you can overcome your fears and fight bad guys so you can take them down so that is why you need to be strong. You also need to be brave so if you get put in a bad situation you will know how to get out of the bad situation so you won't get hurt while you are in the bad situation so that is why need to learn how to get out of a bad situation. You also need to learn how to stay calm in a bad situation if you do not stay calm then you will get hurt so that is why you need to learn how to stay calm in a bad situation. You need to watch out for the terrible situations in the terrible situations then you will get hurt. In the bad situations you usually will not get hurt or injured. So if you are a cowboy you need to watch out for the bad situations and the terrible situations because you will get hurt. So that is why you have to watch out for the bad situations and the terrible situations. So you have to at least tryout for the seagoing cowboys program because you never know what could happen at the program. You could have fun or you could get hurt or injured. So you have to watch out for that so you do not get hurt or injured. If you want to be a cowboy you have guns to protect yourself and when enemies try to shoot you then you can shoot them instead. So you might not get hurt if you carry guns on you for protection. ,"

You also need to learn how to stay calm in a bad situation if you do not stay calm then you will get hurt so that is why you need to learn how to stay calm in a bad situation. You need to watch out for the terrible situations in the terrible situations then you will get hurt. In the bad situations you usually will not get hurt or injured. So if you are a cowboy you need to watch out for the bad situations and the terrible situations because you will get hurt. So that is why you have to watch out for the bad situations and the terrible situations. So you have to at least tryout for the seagoing cowboys program because you never know what could happen at the program. You could have fun or you could get hurt or injured. So you have to watch out for that so you do not get hurt or injured. If you want to be a cowboy you have guns to protect yourself and when enemies try to shoot you then you can shoot them instead. So you might not get hurt if you carry guns on you for protection. ]""

M-cowboy221,"In the story, ""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves,"" Luke is a boy from a small town and is a cowboy that is almost 18 years old. His friend convenced him to go and help the peolpe across seas that are injured from World War ll. He decided to go and help. When he was on his first trip to go to help he turned 18 and was supposte to go into the army but they said to keep helping, and that would be his serivce time.

Luke has a good idea to help spread the word. He should try to convince people to go and help people that got hurt in World War ll. He should start by telling a lot of people about the Seagoing Cowboys program. lso, he should tell people what they do. Next, he should make posters to show people that the Seagoing Cowboys extict. Then, he should say where they going and how they are seeing all of the different historial places along the way. Finally, he should tell the people what the program offers and how they visit many unique places.

Some reasons to join the Seagoing Cowboy programs are, that you get to take care of animals when you are going across the ocean.

When you go different place, you get to see different things that you may of never seen before. When you are over seas you can see many interseting things. That is one reason that you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program.

M-cowboy222,"The Seagonig Cowboys are a group of people who helped serve after World War 2. They brought horses and small cows to towns that were in ruins. To help these countrys they brought food and cattle. They went across the Pacific and Atlantic ocean to give the homeless food.

People should join this program because it help a town in need of assistance. If they didnt they could starve to death. They need to join this program not just for the people you are helping but to help yourself see the good inside yourself. Take Luke, he is a seagoing cowboy that made 9 trips. That is the longest any seagoing cowboy has ever went.

It clearly states on paragraph 5 that "" Besides helping people, I had a side benifit of seeing Europe and China. But seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special.""

M-cowboy223,"Luke should use these reason's to convince other people. The program helps with people in need, people around the world that need supplies, and livestock. The Seagoing Coyboys program is a program for helping other's.

The first reason is the program helps with people in need. Luke and Don go help people and sign up for program. Example-

Luke helped Katie's farm for checking the animals every night. Then he slipped and cracked his ribs so he coudn't work for a couple days. He also took care of cattle while on board.

The second reason is Luke going around the world. He went to many parts of Europe. In Greece he got drafted with the military. He went to China to help animals with crossings. In the Pacific and atlantic ocean he took care of animals, while going to Europe. There were alot things to do.

The last reason is Luke going around and giving supplies. In the first paragraph he worked a two- part job. Then when going to Europe he gave cattle to people or farmers. He probably gave them food and water. The reason is because is the end of WWII and buildings are down.

The Seagoing Cowboys program is a program for helping others. To sum marize the reasons. The program helps with people in need, the program goes around the world, and the program helps with livestock and supplies. Luke did a great thing to help with the world. ","

M-cowboy224,"Being a Seagoing Cowboy was a fun and unique job. Like Luke you got to help many people and visit many places. Such as when Luke mentions that he took a gondola ride in Vinice, Italy, a city with streets of water or when he saw the Acropolis in Greece. You also get to help many people. Luke being a Seagoing Cowboy meant that he supplied poor areas in Europe with cattle to recover their food supplies, animals, and more.

The reason why I say it is fun to be a Seagoing cowboy is, because as Luke mentions when all of the cattle was unloaded they often played table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling and baseball and volleyball games. Luke also mentions that being a Seagoing Cowboy was an oppurtunity of a lifetime that he would not want to miss. Luke aslo mentions that caring for the animals on these long voyages often kept him busy along with other things he had to do such as, feeding the animals, watering the animals two to three times a day, bales of hay and bags of oats had to be pulled from the lower holds of the ship.

Being a Seagoing Cowboy is an interesting job. Your never bored, your always seeing places, and your always having fun. Whats not to like about it? For Luke being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more the adventure, but it opened up the world to him. He also so said that it made him more aware of people of other countries and their needs.

M-cowboy229,"Have you ever been through a major change? You probably have and so has Luke Bomberger, he went from being a rootin tootin cowboy to a seagoing cowboy. So, many people like change, some people hate it. In fact I feel that change is good for us, it helps us come 1,000,000,000,000 miles out of our comfort zone. So if I were you I would take as many chances as I could.

For one Bomberger had a blast traveling to many different places, it says in paragraph 5 he toured an excavated castle in Crete and marveled the panama canal on his way to China .Crazy amazing, right? He was admiring one place on his way to another. What a lucky guy.

Another thing is Bomberger Got to go places that many people may never go. For example He had been to China, Eastern coast of the US, and Europe. Way farther out of North America then Ill ever be. He was probably millions of miles away from where his comfort zone (his house).

Also just the over-all experience you get when you do or try something new. Bomberger states in paragraph 9 that being a seagoing cowboy was much more fun of an adventure. Its all about the people you share the moment with also, they could make it adventerious, scary, fun, or sad.

But do you see getting pushed of of a 1,000,000,000,000 building (your comfort zone) can be fun, scary, or of course uncomfortable. So next time you want to say no to some thing, take chances and say YES. ","

M-cowboy230,"Why should you become a Seagoing Cowboy? Well first let me tell you about a boy named Luke who was a Seagoing Cowboy. A Seagoing Cowboy is on this boat with other Seagoing Cowboys. To go help Europe where World War II just ended.

They were heading over to Europe because, many countries over there were ruined. So they were coming over to bring them food supplies, animals, and more. If you love to help, this would be something for you that you would enjoy. Luke traveled through the Atlantic occean and pacific. Trying to help these countries that were left in ruins. When Luke was on the boat he had a job to do. He had to feed the animals and keep them healthy. He also had to clean the animals and keep there stalls clean.

When your a Seagoing Cowboy you have a big responsibility. You also have alot of jobs to take care of. Another job Luke had, was a night watchman. That job was to check on all the animals every hour. Then make his hourly report to the captain. A Seagoing Cowboy wasn't always working. When they unloaded the animals and were heading back there was an empty space. So sometimes the cowboys played games. Like baseball, volleyball, table-tennis, fincing, boxing, and more. Luke always enjoyed that part.

So this is what a Seagoing Cowboy is and what he does. If your someone who's willing to be on a boat for a long time and take care of animals and if you also love to help people. This job is perfect for you. While your on the boat you get to make new friends and explore unique places. It was just a big adevnture. Also if you love dealing with animals this is another good reason to become a Seagoing Cowboy. Take the information that I gave you. Luke loved being a Seagoing Cowboy and if you have the heart like Luke, this is the job for you. ","

M-cowboy235,"Join the Seagoing Cowboys program, you may enjoy it. In the Seagoing Cowboys program, we travel over to Europe and help the countries recover from World War II by recovering their food supplies, animals, and more, 44 nations joined together to form UNRRA which stands for ""the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration"" who hired the Seagoing Cowboys. Luke said he even had time to have fun playing multiple games when he had the chance. Luke even enjoyed being on an adventure with the Seagoing Cowboys. Join the Seagoing Cowboys today and you can travel across Europe.

The Seagoing Cowboys travel across the Seas to Europe to help it recover from World War II which harmed most of Europe. We'll travel across the Seas on the SS Charles W. Wooster. The SS Charles W. Wooster will be heading towards Greece with a cargo of 335 horses and enough hay and oats to feed them. This is an opportunity of a lifetime that you may never get again. Luke said ""I'm grateful for the opportunity,"" because he enjoyed an adventure like this that the Seagoing Cowboys were on.

While you're with the Seagoing Cowboys, you can meet new people on the trip. You can go to new places that you never been to or never seen. The Seagoing Cowboys take care of horses, young cows, and mules that are going to be shipped overseas. Crossing the Atlantic Ocean will take about 2 weeks from the Eastern coast of the United States and it would also take a month to get to China.

M-cowboy236,"Luke Bomberger had got asked to join this program called '' Seagoing Cowboys.""

He was working at two part time jobs, one of the jobs were grocery store and the other one was the bank. Then, Lukes friend Don Reist invited Luke to go to the cattle boat in Europe. Luke couldnt say no because that has always been Lukes dream. Then he thought, that would be the opportunity of his lifetime to work on the cattle boat!

The reason Luke wanted to work onthe cattle boat was because the World War II just got done in Europe. He also wanted to help Europe get there food supplies, animals, and familys back together. Fourty-Four nations joined in on this program. The name of the program was called ""Seagoing Cows"" because they took care of the horses, young calfs, mules that were on there way over seas. Europe needed despirate help when this incident happened.

Acording to the story, on August 1945, they arrived on August 14th. On that day the Pacific War ended. They had a cargo with 335 horses plus hay and oats to feed them. Luke turned 18 when he was onthe cattle boat headed towrds Greece, and that meant he could be drafted to the military services! By the time he was discharged in 1947, Luke Bomberger had made nine trips, then he got told that he had the most Seagoing Cowboys trips in the program!

Luke always said ""the cattle-boat trips were so unbelievable opportunity for a small town boy!"" Besides helping people Luke had the benefit of seeing Europe and China. Seeing the Acropolis was very special, Luke said. He enjoyed being a Seagoing Cowboy.

Being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more than an adventure for Luke Bomberger. It opened up his world to help people and be kind and helpful to people who need help. A good reason for joining the Seagoing Cowboys program is because you can relize how you have good towns and good houses and some countries don't have that. It shows how you canbe helpful and you need to be greatful for what you have and dont have!","

You should join because UNRRA hired ''Seagoing Cowboys'' to take care or the horses, young cows, and mules that where shipped overseas. Its a important job to take care of the animals there our resource! You get to see and vist amazing places! And when you are in the program you get to help people out and help them recover. Its a good and nice thing that you are helping people out.

In the book ''A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves.'' A character from that book name Luke joined the Seagoing Cowboys program. His friend Don Reist invited him to go to Europe on a cattle boat.

Then in August 1945, they received their orders to report to New Orleans. They arrived August 14. Luke then says,''the day the Pacific war ended.''

Luke turned 18 before arriving in Greece, which meant he could be drafted for military service. Then Luke was on a cattle-boat trip, they told Luke to just keep doing that for Luke's service. Luke was discharged in 1947, Luke had made nine trips-the most of any Seagoing Cowboy. For Luke the cattle-boat trips where unbelievable opportunity for a small-town boy, he says.

Besides Luke helping people, he had side benefit of seeing Europe and china. But seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special for Luke. And Luke got to go to a gondola ride in Venice , Italy,a city with streets of water. Luke also toured an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on his way to China. Maybe if you Join the Seagoing Cowboys program you can experience all these wonderful places like Luke did! And you can be helpful in this program.

On Luke second trip, he had to serve as night watchman. And his job was to check on all the animals every hour. Now, thats a tough job to do. But Luke was helpful and he did his job and he loves his job he does. To sum things up the jobs sometimes be a little hard to do but Luke never gave up on his job!

M-cowboy240,"This story is about Luke Bomberger a boy who rode the waves had no idea that his life would change soon after his graduation. He was working two part-time jobs in a grocery store and at a bank when his friend invited him to go to Europe on a cattle boat. He couldn't say no he knew it would be an opportunity for him. It was 1945,world war 2 was over in Europe and countries were left in ruins. To help these countries recover 44 nations came together and started UNRRA {The United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration}. UNRRA hired seagoimg cowboys to take care of the horses,young cows, and the mules.

The first reason to join the program is because they came together and started a group of 44 nations to help Europe. They hired ''Seagoing Cowboys'' to help the animals. They are trying to get the nation back together. Luke and Don signed up for it to. Heading over seas in August 1945, they recieved their orders to report to New Orleans. They arrived ''August 14,'' Luke sayed,the day the Pacific war ended.''

The second reason you should join the group is because '' The cattle-boat trips were an unbelievable opportunity for a small-town boy,'' he said.''Besides helping people, had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China. But seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special,'' he says. ''So was taking a Gondola ride in Venice,Italy,a city with streets of water.'' Luke also toured an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on his way to china.

The third reason why you should join the group is cause caring for the animals during the crossings kept luke busy. They had to be fed and watered two or three times a day. Bales of hayand bags of oats had to be pulled up from the lower holds of the ship. Stalls had to be cleaned. Helping out on his aunt Katie's farm as a boy had prepared luke for hard work.

In conclusion I think you can still help with or without an reward. He did that from heart to help and sign up for that, also he liked watching the animals every hour and taking care of them so did his friend. He really liked the trips around the world too, just help to be nice somtimes for other people.","

M-cowboy242,"Being a Seagoing Cowboy is a great experience. You don't only help people, but you also get a benefit of seeing amazing places. If you love animals you can take care of them. You get to have fun and know that you're doing something that helps others.

Luke was just a small town boy and he got a great opportunity. First he had two part-time jobs at a grocery store and a bank. Luke was invited to be a Seagoing Cowboy by his friend Don. He accepted it and knew he was going to have a lifetime opportunity. Luke had a benefit of seeing Europe and China, saw the Acropolis in Greece, took a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, toured an excavated castle in Crete, and marveled at the Panama Canal on his way to China.

This job may be fun, but it still is a life changing experience. You see more than you could see just from home. You also know you're changing other people's lives. Luke may have had a wonderous adventure, but it also made him more aware of the needs in other countries.","

Luke said, ""Being a Seagoing Cowboy he got to see Europe, China and he got to see the Acropolis in Greece."" He got to see so many great sites. Luke toured an excaveted castle in crete and he marveled at the Panama Canal on his way to China.

Luke had to travel a lot. But, even though it took two weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern coast of the United states and a month to get to China. On the long journey

Luke stayed busy by taking care of animals. Taking care of animals and traveling was not all Luke did on the boat, the cowboys played lots of games. Some of the games they played was baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where animals lived. They also did table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling and other games to pass time.

Luke said that ""being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more than an adventure."" For Luke it opened up the world to him. Luke had a lot of fun seeing different sites, meeting new people, playing fun games and caring for people in a different, and better way.                       ","

Another reason that Luke thought you should join or partcipate is you can take care of horses,young cows,and mules that are being shipped overseas. You also get to feeed the horses.When you have time on the ship you can play baseball,volleyball,table-tennis tournaments,fencing,boxing,reading,whittling,and games to pass the time. It even opens up the world for you to discover.

When Luke was discovering the world he was grateful for the opportunity and it also made him aware of people of other countries and their needs. Luke also made 16 trips around the Alantic Ocean and the Pacific Ocean 2 times to help people who were affected by World War ll. Another reason to join the Seagoing cowboys program is you can see the people in needs who got their houses destroyed in World War ll. When Luke was in the Seagoing Cowboys program he visited many unique places like New Orleans,Greece,Europe,China and he also took a gondola ride in Venice, Italy and also toured a excavated castle in Crete.

You should be careful while being a watchman in the dark because Luke slid on a slippery ladder on his backside. A small strip oh metal stopped his slide from flying overboard. He was happy to be alive but he couldn't work for a couple days of his cracked ribs. Also Luke travled on the Charles w. Wooster and as heading to Greece. It will take 2 weeks to cross the Alantic Ocean. Also what he did on the ship is he cleaned stalls which you might have to do.The last thing he did was help out in the kitchen.

M-cowboy250,"""A cowboy who rode the waves"" is a story where there is so much going on with so many people.

The main character in the story is ""Luke Bomberger"" he works two part-time jobs one at the Grocery Store and the other at the Bank. He has a friend named Don

Reist whom asked Luke to go to Europe with him. They would be riding on a cattle boat with 335 horses only. The reason they had to ride on a cattle boat was because World War 2 just ended and most people animals and buildings got destroyed. They were shipping animals over to Europe so that they could have their animals back. He just turned 18 before they left so he was old enough to help out. Since they had all of the horses he helped out with taking care of them they each had to be fed and watered two or three times a day. He was really good at taking care of all the horses because he used to help out on his aunt's farm with all of the animals. He had trouble sometimes when the storms would be super bad and it would make the boat rock with the bad waves. One time he was going to report back to the captin with the news on how the animals were doing because he was on nightwatch and he slipped and fell off of his ladder. When the boat started tilting he went slididng down the deck of the boat and amost went off board. He didn't go off board luckily because a metal bar stopped him from going two far but he did suffer from broken ribs and have to take some time off. On the trips back to go get more animals the people he was with would play games with him and they also got to see amazing sights on their way there and back sometimes even on the way there is they weren't too busy.

Most of the time this is what happens but his story is really interesting. Most people think it is a horrible idea to do this but I think it's a great one because you get to help people. It is nice to do something like that because most people are less fortunet and things that happened in Europe can happen to them and maybe even you when you don't ever expect it.","

M-cowboy257,"I think other people should participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program because you could explore alot of things.

The reason I think people should participate in this program is because you get to go on vacations and you almost get to explore around the world. You also are crossing the Atlantic Ocean and also going to China. It also seems like a fun activity because in paragraph nine it says that Luke was grateful for the opportunity. In paragraph five it also says that he toured and excavated castle's while he was on his way to China. You had to do a little work to because its says in paragraph seven during the crossings it kept Luke busy and he had to check the animals every hour. I also believe it is alot of traveling because in the introduction it says that Luke crossed the Atlantic Ocean more than 16 times. In paragraph nine it also talks about how he felt much more than just an adventure for Luke. In paragraph four its says that they knew he was a cattle-boat trip but they told him just to keep doing it for his service.

There is also many other different things to do if you want to become a Seagoing Cowboy and I think Luke really enjoyed it because in paragraph seven it says that Luke was happy to be alive. Also on Luke's second trip he served as a night watchman but he couldn't work for a couple of days because he cracked his ribs.

That is why I think people should patrticipate in the program because it sounds fun and enjoyable and you could also join with your friends. ","

Wooster, and then they headed to Greece. THe SS Charles also had a cargo of 335 horses plus enough hay and oat so they can eat.

On his second trip Luke had to served his night as a watchman. His job was to check on the animal every hour. On this one rainy night after making his hourly report to the captain he slid down a slippery ladder on his backside.

M-cowboy265,"Luke's point of view is that other people should participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program. One reason is because you get to go to different places. Another reason is because Luke was already for this because he worked on a farm with Katie.

You get to go to different places like Greece, and by time he got to Greece he was 18 years old that meant that he could draft for military service. Then he could see Europe and China. They crossed the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern coast of the United States and a month to get to China. Caring for the animals during the crossing kept luke busy. They had to feed and water them two to three times a day. The stalls had to be cleaned.

Luke was already for this because he worked on a farm with aunt Katie's farm as a boy had perpared Luke for hard work but not the dangers at the sea. He had different jobs each time. The second time he was a watchman. And his job was to check the animals every hour.

But being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more than an adventure for Luke. It had opened the world to him. But he was greatful for the opportunity. It made him more aware of of people of other countries and their needs. And the awareness stayed with him, leading his family to host a number of international students and exchange visitors for many years.

That is why Luke's point of view for people to participate in the Seagoing Cow boys. And I think that it would be good for people to do what he did that way you get to go to different places that you may of not been to before. And that way you get to see what it's like on the sea taking care of all the animals and all of the jobs that you have to do.

It would be cool if people would do what Luke did that way you get a learning time where you get to see what it was like for Luke and do what he did I think that it would be cool I we did that. And If we did what he did I think that it would be fun takeing care of the animals and on a sea ride and going to different places that are in different countries to see what there life is like and how they eat and things like that would be cool.","

M-cowboy267,"Would one like to be a Seagoing Cowboy? Well it's a bad idea to be a Seagoing Cowboy. Well first, one has to be on sea for a couple weeks. Then one also has to responsibe for taking care of animals. And lastly, one needs to be careful on a cattle boat. Being a Seagoing Cowboy is a bad, dangerous, and horrible idea.

First, a Seagoing Cowboy has to travel all around the world. Does one really wants to be sea sick? Well a Seagoing Cowboy needs to be on a cattle boat for maybe about two weeks or maybe more across the ocean. And one needs to worry about the dangers of the sea. Lastly, one needs to take night shifts for a couple reasons. What about the rest they need of being so busy? In conclusion, being a Seagoing Cowboy is about dealing with the sea. So, not only the sea is a bad idea for a job, but also taking care of the animals.

A Seagoing Cowboy is not only traveling, but also taking care of the animals. First, a Seagoing Cowboy has to take night shifts just for taking care of the creatures. One needs to check on all the animals every hour as well. Furthermore, one needs to feed them every two or three times a day. Who's going to clean the ship after the animals eat? Next, one needs to give them water as well as a plants, animals, and Seagoing Cowboys needs water. So, does one really want to be dealing with the animals and the care they need? Not only being a Sea Cowboy is a terrible idea, but also taking care of themselves and the boat.

Sometimes a Sea Cowboy can be tough, but they also need to be careful of what they're doing. Did one hear of how Luke hurt himself? Well he had a report from his captain and slid down a slippery ladder. Why was it so slippery? Well he was on a boat with water surrounding it! And if one slipped and can't swim, and went in the water...well that one person will be at the bottom of the dark Atlantic sea. But Luke cracked his ribs just from sliding down on a slippery lader on his backside. One also needs be careful of whats ahead of them. The dangers of the sea, the water, and other people who are going to want to stop a Seagoing Cowboy from saving a country. So why be a Seagoing Cowboy?

In conclusion, a Seagoing Cowboy will need to take care of themselves of being injured or sea sick, animals, and what a Seagoing Cowboy will have ahead of them. So DON'T be a Seagoing Cowboy who might be at a great risk. Next, don't be at th bottom of the sea. Another, reason for being a Seagoing Cowboy is because one doesn't want to be frustrated of taking care of couple of animals. And please don't be on a cattle boat if one doesn't want to clean what animals/peoples left overs. These are the reasons why being a Seagoing Cowboy is a terrible, horrible, bad idea.        ","

From the amazing experience Luke had you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program.

It is an amazing opportunity to help people and to explore new places it also served as work if you were drafted to go to the military. Luke could help people because it was World War II in Europe and many countries were left in ruins so he had to help recover their food supplies, animals, and more. Luke also got to explore new places while being in the program he got to go to Europe and China he got to tour an excavated castle in Crete and see the Panama Canal on his way to China. When Luke was drafted but he didn't have to go to war because he served his service as a Seagoing Cowboy. This evidence proves that Being a Seagoing Cowboy is a great opportunity. Although, there are many dangers to the sea during this job such as slipping and possibly falling out of the ship. However, there are many more good things than bad thisng during this job it is hard but you get to help others whle putting yourself in danger.

Based on the evidence in the passage and what Luke's experience was like the Seagoing Cowboys program is an very good opportunity. It allows you to help others in need, it also lets you serve your service in the military if your are drafted, and during it you may also get to explore several new places you have never been.","

Well if you join or participate the Seagoing Cowboys program you will get to go to so many places like different countries,and castles. Not only that, But save lives in different countries. You will miss out on so many fun adventures and other peoples lifes and countries if you don't join the program.

If you join the program then you will have so much fun with all the different places and adventures. One of the people who come here, named Luke has been to so many beautiful places. Luke has made nine trips, more than any member in the Seagoing Cowboys. Luke has toured an excavated castle in Crete and went to the Panama canal on his way to China.

If it wasn't for Luke's friend, Don Reist,he would have never been a member and he would have never seen any of these places that he has been to. Luke knew it was an oppurtunity of a lifetime. At the time Luke joined, World war 2 was over in Europe. Many countries were ruined and needed help, so Don and Luke joined to go on a mission to go to other countries that were ruined to help the countries recover their food supplies,animals,and more.

Your student, John, submitted the following essay and he is talking about the dream of becoming a cowboy:

""[Essay Content: Do you like going on fun adventures, saving lifes and vistiting many unique places? Well if you join or participate the Seagoing Cowboys program you will get to go to so many places like different countries,and castles. Not only that, But save lives in different countries. You will miss out on so many fun adventures and other peoples lifes and countries if you don't join the program.

If you join the program then you will have so much fun with all the different places and adventures. One of the people who come here, named Luke has been to so many beautiful places. Luke has made nine trips, more than any member in the Seagoing Cowboys. Luke has toured an excavated castle in Crete and went to the Panama canal on his way to China.

If it wasn't for Luke's friend, Don Reist,he would have never been a member and he would have never seen any of these places that he has been to. Luke knew it was an oppurtunity of a lifetime. At the time Luke joined, World war 2 was over in Europe. Many countries were ruined and needed help, so Don and Luke joined to go on a mission to go to other countries that were ruined to help the countries recover their food supplies,animals,and more.

""The cattle-boat trips were an unbelievable opportunity for a small-town boy,"" he says. Luke has gotten hurt for other people, because he knew that what was going on in their lifes,are far worse than his. He has traveled alot and seen alot that has happend in other countries, and they need more people to save them.

Being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more than an adventure for Luke Bomberger. ""I'm grateful for the opportunity,"" he says. ""It made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs.""

M-cowboy279,"Luke would tell people to join the Seagoing Cowboys program because it is an opportunity of a lifetime. Many people wish to do this, but they may never be able to be a part of this program, so that is why he would tell you to participate in this program.

Another reason Luke would try to convince you to join is because you could be helping people and countries by taking care of animals, such as horses, young cows, and mules.

Luke would also tell people to join the Seagoing Cowboys because you could visit new places you have never been to before, like Europe or China, or Greece and Italy. Luke had the chance of visiting these four places because he was part of the Seagoing Cowboys, and you get to cross oceans, like the Atlantic and Pacific.

Another reason luke would tell you to join the program would be because you would always be busy. The animals all needed food and water two or three times a day. Bales of hay and bags of oats ave to be pulled up from the lower level. And their stalls have to be cleaned.

Luke would also tell you to be careful if you joined the Seagoing Cowboys. On Luke's second trip, he almost fell into the dark waters of the Atlantic. He served as a watchman, and he would have to check on the animals every hour. And one rainy night, when he was going to report to the captain, he slid down a slippery ladder on his backside. His heart raced as he shot feet first toward an opening on the side of the ship. But luckily, a small strip of metal along the edge stopped him from sliding towrad the the dark Atlantic, and kept him aboard the ship. Luke was happ he was alive, but he had to take a couple of days off of work because he cracked his ribs.

But you can also have fun on the ship, especially on return trips after the animals had been unloaded. They would play baseball or volleyball games in the empty holds where the animals had been. Table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and games also helped time go by faster.

Being part of a Seagoing Cowboy can be a great expierience, and it was for Luke Bombergur. It opened the world to him. He said he was grateful for the opportunity of being part of the program. It made him more aware of people of other countries and their needs. And that awareness stayed with him, leading his family to host a number of international students and exchange visitors for many years.

That's why you should be part of the Seagoing Cowboys. It will give you great memories that will stay with you. It will give you life expierience that you might need later on in your life. It will give chances to visit new places you might love and never forget about. It will give you a chance of helping people and countries around the world. It will give you a chance to meet new people and to get to know them well. It will give you all of this and much, much more. That is why you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program. Once you decline it, you will regret you did. Once you accept it, you will be happy you entered this program.","

M-cowboy281,"In the story ""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves"" it gives information about a certain group called the Seagoing Cowboys program. One reason to join the Seagoing Cowboys program is you get to take care of animals for your service to your country in stead of having to be in the military. According to the fourth paragraph when Luke turned eighteen before getting to Greece, he would've had to automatically draft into the military. But, when the draft board learned that he was on a cattle-boat trip, they told him to just stay their for his service. Point being if you serve by being a Seagoing Cowboy you wouldn't have to be in the military enless you choose to be in it.

There are many reason's provided in the story to be a Seagoing Cowboy but one that also seems to stick out above some of the others is the sight's you see. According to paragraph five it says ""The cattle-boat trips were an unbelievable opportunity for a small-town boy,"" he says. ""Besides helping people, I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China. But seeing the Acropolis in Greece wasspecial,"" he says.""So was taking a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, a city with streets of water."" Luke also toured an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on his way to China."" Which means that if you're a Seagoing Cowboy you get to see a bunch of unique places that most people don't get to see everyday.

For my last reason that I found stated in the text to be a Seagoing Cowboy is it opens up a new world for you. As stated in the text paragraph nine ""But being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more than an adventure for Luke Bomberger. It opened up the world to him."" which shows that it teaches you and what caring for others does for you and last it shows sights you don't get to see 24/7. To conclude the paragraph being a Seagoing Cowboy is much more than seeing things you haven't seen before outside of pictures and going on adventures it's a great learning experience.

If you join the Seagoing Cowboys program you will get the great delight of caring for others, adventure, sight-seeing, and a great learning experience. All the information above is my reason's or benefits of being a Seagoing Cowboy. Think about the reason's to see if being a Seagoing cowboy is what you want to be.

M-cowboy282,"In the article ""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves"" , Luke joined , or signed up , for the Seagoing Cowboys. This job was to do hard work overseas to help with cattle and feed.

On their way, Luke went and seen different places,like China! Convincing others to participate in this important job would be hard. I think it would be hard because it is hard work. You also have to go overseas , away from your family and friends.

It would be hard to convince people to participate, or help. This is because, it is hard work, and your always busy. Here is an example from the article,""His job was to check on all the animals every hour."" That proves that he is always busy. ""But he couldn't work for a couple of days because of cracked ribs."" That is an example that he is hard working.

They have to go overseas to Greece to work as a Seagoing Cowboy. Here is an example from the text, ""They got their seaman's papers and boarded the SS Charles W. Wooster, headed for Greece."" People would miss their friends and family. They would also be sore from all the hard work they have to do.

Luke was greatful from start to end. In the beginning he was greatful to participate. In the middle, he done hard work , visited and saw great experiances. In the end, he was sore but really greatful for his part. ""I'm greatful for the opportunity."" he says. ""It made me more aware of people of other countriesand their needs."" That was an example in the text.

First of all, many countries in Europe were left in ruins and needed help. The countries are in need of their food supplies, animals, and more. With the help of more men, those needed supplies could be delievered with ease.

Along with all the hard work, there is also some fun on board, especially on return trips after the animals had been unloaded. The cowboys play baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where the animals had been housed. Table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and games are also other activities that they enjoyed.

Even with everything the Seagoing Cowboys do, they are grateful for the opportunity. Besides helping people, the cowboys had the side benefit of seeing some beautiful countries. It also made the cowboys aware of people in other countries and their needs.

In conclusion, that is why more people should sign up for the Seagoing Cowboys program. There are people in need, there is some fun on the board, and then there's the side benefit of seeing countries in or near Europe. Someday, maybe even you will be interested in joining the Seagoing Cowboys.","

M-cowboy285,"Being a seagoing cowboy is great because I travel to lots of places such as: China, Europe, and lots more places.

Seagoing Cowboys take care of horses, cows, and mules that were shipped oversea. Also a benefit for being a Seagoing Cowboy is that you travel by sea to China, Europe, Greeece, and Italy. On a Seagoing Cowboy's free time they play Baseball and Volleyball. They also had tournaments such as Table tennis, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and games to help pass time. One disadvantage in being a Seagoing Cowboy is that you are suck in sea, so you can get sea sick, Also the animals can get hard to handle from time to time.

Being a Seagoing Cowboy is great because of the place you go to. Also the stuff you do on the ship like games. However, being a Seagoing Cowboy is to help out on the World War II by exporting animales and crates of food and stuff to other places.","

M-cowboy286,"Would you ever want to have a job that you could explore the ocean and visit many different countrys and see unique things. It would be nice to have a job like that

In the passage ''A Cowboy Who Rode The Waves''this boy named Luke bomberger, who just graduated high school had two jobs and he got offered by his friend Don Reist to join this exiting event. Luke could not say no.

In the passage Luke said that he enjoyed the job A lot. There was many things he got to do like go over seas,he rescued animals,and more. It states in paragraph 3 that he traveled with 335 horses on August,14,1945. In my opinion that is a lot of horses on one boat.

He got to travel many places like Europe,China,Greece and more. He said that it takes about two weeks to get to cross the Atlantic ocean and a month to get to China. left time to play baseball,vollyball,tabletennis,fencing,boxing reading,and more. it says in the intro in the passage that he traveled 16 times over the Atlantic Ocean and twice over the Pacific Ocean.

As you can see it would be A lot of fun to be A seagoing cowboy. You would get to adventure things just like Luke did. In my opinion that would be A lot of fun to travel over seas and save people and animals. Not only that you will also be able to explore many things like China and Europe. and you might even see very historic things. I hope you think about this job. It could be an opportunity of a lifetime.                                ","

Obviously, if the people reading this are like most guys and want to do those amazing things, sign up to be a seagoing cowboy. It's the oppurtunity of a lifetime!

Lets face it, we are those people's only hope, They are dieing out there. The only solution is to become a seagoing cowboy and save them.

The second reason all guys should become a seagoing cowboy, it involves getting to have fun while hanging out with other guys. On the ship while the cowboys are going to other countries to help other people, they get to have boatloads of fun. The cowboys often play baseball and volleyball games when they hang out with eachother. Not to mention the table tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, and reading. The cowboys are never bored and are always finding something fun to do. Clearly, being a seagoing cowboy is a very fun and relaxing job.

The final reason all guys should become a seagoing cowboy, they get to explore the world and see amazing places. The cowboys get to see Europe and China daily. They also get to explore all of the amazing place there like the Acropolis in Greece, Venice, Italy, castles in Crete, and the Panama Canal. Anyone who wants to see the the amazing world should definitley sign up to be a seagoing cowboy. This really is the oppurtunity of a lifetime for everyone who is dieing to get out of the house.

Some people may love home but really want to go on this trip. They also may not want to leave their beautiful family behind all by themselves. It might be possible that they are just scared to travel to an unknown place, but, being a seagoing cowboy allows the cowboys to only take one trip to help others, have fun, and see the world. It won't take very long at all!

Being a seagoing cowboy is an amazing job to take. The cowboys get to help other countries, have fun, and see the world and all of its beauties. Everyone who has ever become a cowboy has had the time of there life. Wait, have all the people who were reading this story stop to sign up?   ","

M-cowboy289,"As Luke says you can take many great expeditions, and it made him more aware of people and their needs. Luke had just turned 18 and that meant he could be drafted into war. But he was on a cattle boat so he could keep doing service there.

By the time of 1947 he was discharged, Luke had taken nine trips! That's a record for any Seagoing Cowboy. A big reason that you should join it (as Luke recalls), is because you get to help people in need. And get to lean more about there country. In the story Luke says that he got to see the Panama Canal. Wouldn't that be amazing?

Luke felt that it would be a chance of a lifetime to go and be a Seagoing Cowboy, and he just couldn't say ""no"" to Don. In 1945 WWII ended and many countries were left in ruins. So Don and Luke signed up to help. They helped for about two years before they were released.

He says that he also has much fun on board as well, especially on return trips after the animals had been unloaded. They played games of tennis and volley ball where the animals once were. You'd have much fun on board and on trips.

Those are just a few examples of why you should want to be a ""Seagoing Cowboy"". As Luke says it is much more than an adventure. It opened the world up to him and is grateful for the oppertunity that he had. There is so much more to learn about as well but if I were to try to explain it all I would need a lot more space. ","

Luke couldn't say no so, he went with him for an opportunity of a life time.

In 1945, World War ll was over in Europe and many countries were left in ruins. 44 nation joined together to form a UNRRA ( the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitatiion Administration ). After that the UNRRA hired the ""Seagoing Cowboys"" to take care of the young farm animals that were shipped overseas. When luke turned 18 years old right before he arriving in Greece, which meant he could be drafted for military service. In 1947, Luke made nine trips-the most of any Seagoing Cowboy was ever been through.

The cattle-boat trips were unbelievable opportunity for a smal- town boy, Luke also toured an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on his way to China. It took about two weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern coast of the United States and a month to get to China. Bales of hay and bags of oats had to be pulled up from the lower holds of the ship. Stalls had to be cleaned. Luke also found time to have fun on board, esspecially on return trips after the animals had been unloaded. The cowboys played music, played games, sports they played, and also read to have some relaxation.

But being a Seagoing Cowboy for Luke was much more an adventure for him it also gaved him much more experience to the world than he imagined. It made Luke more aware of peole of other countries their needs. and that awareness stayed ith him, leading his family to host a number of international student and exchanged visitors for many years.

M-cowboy292,"Luke thinks other people should participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program. He graduated in Highschool, had two jobs and didnt know his life would change. Don his friend invited him to go to Europe and he knew it was an opportunity of a lifetime.

In the passage it says it was 1945, World War II was over in Europe and many countrys were left in ruins. Europe was in trouble because they needed to recover their food supplies, animals, and more. So if anything like this happened you could help them out.

The passage also says In August 1945, they received their orders to report to New Orleans. Not only you would work in Europe you would be around the world and that could be a unique adventure which you could do if u joined Seagoing Cowboys.

Lastly the passage says Luke turned 18 before arriving in Greece, which meant he could be drafted for military service. Just for signing up for the Seagoing Cowboys program it could take you to higher places.

In conclusion joining the Seagoing Cowboys program would be really intresting. You might just go to a place you always wanted to go but your not just going there because you want to go your going their for a good cause.","

Also,Luke didn't just have fun for himself,he also helped people who were affected by World War II. The group that helped those runied countries and affected people were UNRRA (the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration).Where Luke comes in is when the UNRRA needed people to take care of horses,young cows,and mules that were shipped overseas the UNRRA hired Seagoing Cowboys to do that job. After hearing about that Luke and his friend Don signed up. Also its not boring on the ship full of animals because the cowboys could do the following;baseball,vollyball,table-tenis,fencing,boxing,reading,whittling and games.

M-cowboy295,"The Seagoing Cowboys program started after World War Two ended in Europe. The program gives young cows, horses, and mules to the countries that got destroyed in the war. They put the young cows, horses, and mules on ships then sent them to different countries.

I had two different part-time jobs and when my friend told me about this opportunity to join the Seagoing Cowboys I thought it was a once in a lifetime opportunity.

I joined the Seagoing Cowboys on the day that the war in the Pacific ended.

My very first trip was to Greece. The ships had cows and horses on them. The Sea Cowboys had to feed them twice a day, clean out their stalls, and give them fresh water to drink. There was another job to be done on ths ship there was the night watchman. The night watchmen had to check in on the animals every hour then report it to the captain. This job can be very dangerous at times because one rainy night I went to tell the captain and slid down the ladder and almost went overboard into the dark, churning ocean. A small piece of metal saved my life. I was okay but I did have two broken ribs.

I Luke did the most trips of any Seagoing Cowboy. I did sixteen across the Atlantic Ocean and two across the Pacific Ocean. I would want people to join the Seagoing Cowboys because when you are at the country that you are helping you get to visit many tourist attractions. When I was in Greece I got to see the Acropolis. The Acropolis is an ancient structure built in ancient times. I got to ride in a gondola in Venice, Italy. I toured an excavated castle in Crete. I also marveled at the Panama Canal on his way back from China.

On return trips after the animals were dropped off the men had fun. They had baseball and volleyball games in empty stalls, they also had table tennis tournements, along with boxing tournements. I also found time to have fun reading, whittling, and other fun games to pass the time at sea.

The Seagoing Cowboys would be a great way to help out others in need. I had a very amazing experience as a Seagoing Cowboy. I would want other young boys to have the same experience as I did when I joined the seagoing cowboys.

Luke says in the article, "" I'm grateful for the opportunity. It made me more aware of other people and countries' needs. Luke kept helping other people in need even after his adventure as a Seagoing Cowboy by leading his family to home a couple of international students and exchange families for many years. Luke had a great experience as a Seagoing Cowboy and he would want you to have the same experience as he did. Join the Seagoing Cowboys and help other people in need all around the world. Help the whole enire world by giving other people the things they need to survive. Luke did not notice how lucky he was until he joined the Seagoing Cowboys. Luke and others of those who served other people on the Seagoing Cowboys boats will have the right to say that they made a difference in this world. Luke would want you to make a difference. Join the Seagoing Cowboys today to make a difference in the world.

In the story A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves it state in paragraph 4, in World War two over in Europe and many other places they was left in ruins so 44 nations joined togethere to form a UURRA and they hired ""Seagoing Cowboys"" to take care of the animals they was shipping over seas. That is why I believe participating in the Seagoing Cowboys program is a good thing cause you can help other countrys in need.

In the story it sate i paragraph 6 that the boy Luke that was in the Seagoing Program he was over seas for two weeks before he had got to china. That is one of the reason why i think that being in the Seagoing Cowboys is a good way for you to go places you never been before

Last, the passage state in paragraph 9 that being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more that a adventure for Luke Bomberger. This is why I choose to think that it is a great idea to be in the Seagoing Cowboys program cause you can see stuff that you never in your life seen before and have adventures.

This shows why I have stick to believe that it is good idea for people to participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program.","

That is why I believe participating in the Seagoing Cowboys program is a good thing cause you can help other countrys in need.

In the story it sate i paragraph 6 that the boy Luke that was in the Seagoing Program he was over seas for two weeks before he had got to china. That is one of the reason why i think that being in the Seagoing Cowboys is a good way for you to go places you never been before

Last, the passage state in paragraph 9 that being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more that a adventure for Luke Bomberger. This is why I choose to think that it is a great idea to be in the Seagoing Cowboys program cause you can see stuff that you never in your life seen before and have adventures.

This shows why I have stick to believe that it is good idea for people to participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program.]""

M-cowboy299,"The Seagoing Cowboys program was probably the best thing that ever happened to me. In the Seagoing Cowboys program, we sail to Europe (and many other countries) and see magnificant sights on the way. The Seagoing Cowboys in a huge opportunity that you should take!

The concept of the Seagoing Cowboys it to help countries recover their food supplies, animals, and more. If you join the UNRRA (the United Nations Relief and Rehibilitation Administration) Seagoing Cowboys you will not regret it. You will be having a great time, while helping other people and making new friends on the boat. While I was on my cattle-rides I have visited many places like Venice, Italy, Europe, China, and many other fasinating landscapes. Being on the Seagoing Cowboys also taught me that work can be fun! During free time, you could enjoy a wide variety of activities including table tennis, boxing, fencing, whittling, and many other games.

The years that I participated in the Seagoing Cowboys program were some of the best years of my life. Joining the Seagoing Cowboys program is a once-in-a-lifetime experience that no one should pass up on! ","

M-cowboy300,"'' Do you think that it would be fun to be a Seagoing Cowboy?'', Parker questioned

'' I think that it would be a great idea. ,I stated We could go on the ships to see different countries on our free time and we could have fun watching the animals.''

Many resonsons why I think that you should join the Seagoing Cowboy program are you can help out people and you can visit cool places while you are traveling. Also you could get a chance to learn how it feels to help someone out that really needs it like Luke did.

Luke also got the opportunities to see China and Europe, the Acropolis in Greece, take a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, a city with streets of water, and he toured a excavated castle in Crete and he saw the Panama Canal on his way to China, like you could if you did something like this.

Also if you did this you would have the opportunity to see and travel the different oceans like Luke did in his travels.

My conclusion is if you join the Seagoing Cowboy program you will enjoy the sights you see and the wonderful feeling of helping out people ineed in other countries.

I think this because in the article it says ''Being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more than an adventure for Luke Bomberger. It opened up the world to him. I'm grateful for the opportunity,'' he says ''It made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs.'' And that

Awareness stayed with him, leading his family to host a number of international students and exchange vistiors for many years. That is why I think you should join the Seagoing Cowboy program.            ","

F-cowboy2,"The main characters were Luke and his friend. Basically the story is about his friend giving him a once in a life time opportunity. He first worked at a grocery store and and the bank. When his friend invited him to go to Europe on a cattle boat. He couldnt say no. So then he went.

He had graduated from high school and had 2 jobs but whem his friend invited him to Europe his whole llife had changed. Since there was a war he went to go help out. He and Don had signed up to be a segoing cowboy. 44 nations joined toggether and formed a UNNRA and he was hired to be a seagoing cowboy. That when you have to take care of horses , mules adnd young cows. That was his job over there in Europe.

He kept going there and he kept helping others. He like his job. The cattle boats were unbelievable for a small town boy it had said. He really enjoyed his job. He toured lots of places like Venice Italy and a city with streets of water. But Luke had made 9 trpis the most of any seagoing cowboy. He traveled across the atlantic ocean and it took him about 2 weeks.

He was taking care of lots of animals and was feeding them 2 or 3 times a day. Bales of hay and bags of oats. They had to be pulled. He had helped out his aunt Katie as a boy. So he was prepared for this. On his second trip he was served as a night watchman. His job was to check the animals every hour. Then one rainy night he had slipped down on a slippery ladder. His heart raced. But luckly he lived.

This ssums up about everythung. His life had changed a whpole lot. Thanks to his friend Don. He liked helping out. He couldnt work though because he had cracked ribs. After that he returned to being a seagoing cowboy. Then it made him more aware of peopl in other countries and thier need.               ","

F-cowboy5,"Luke should not be a sea going cowboy.This is why in paragraph 2 he said when he went over seas world war ll was begining, if he was caught by any air troopers they would have bombed the boat he was on and it would have sinked into that deep blue ocean. For example when he was on the boat he had an hourly role call acording to the story he fell and cracked his ribs if the metal pole did'nt stop him he would have went over board and eaten by a shark but he was fine he had to take a break for a couple of days. Why he should'nt go over seas to be a sea going cowboy is that you can get hurt a lot and get sea sick but the most important thing is that if he keeps up what he is doing he will get really hurt do his job any more.

Your student, Emily, submitted the following essay and she is talking about the dream of becoming a cowboy:

""[Essay Content: Luke should not be a sea going cowboy.This is why in paragraph 2 he said when he went over seas world war ll was begining, if he was caught by any air troopers they would have bombed the boat he was on and it would have sinked into that deep blue ocean. For example when he was on the boat he had an hourly role call acording to the story he fell and cracked his ribs if the metal pole did'nt stop him he would have went over board and eaten by a shark but he was fine he had to take a break for a couple of days. Why he should'nt go over seas to be a sea going cowboy is that you can get hurt a lot and get sea sick but the most important thing is that if he keeps up what he is doing he will get really hurt do his job any more. In paragrah4 when he was discharged he had made nine trips across the world

acording to the paragraph.]""

F-cowboy10,"A argument Luke is dealing with from his point of view is how much things he has to do and if he does the commands wrong there will be horrible consequences for them.

When Luke heard about the job he was so excited about it. He heard that being a Seagoing Cowboy was a amazing job. He has been dreaming about being a Seagoing Cowboy because of all the animals you take care of and all the traveling they do. That's why right away when Luke heard that they are hiring Seagoing Cowboys, he couldn't say no. It was a opportunity of a lifetime!

As soon as Luke got hired, he was so excited to start working. He worked and worked all the time. He wanted to be the best Seagoing cowboy there has ever been. Sometimes he would work more than he was soppost to. He enjoyed taking care of the horses, young cows, and mules.

Luke worked very hard and sometimes got tired. He went to alot of places. He went to New Orleans and Greece and other places. As soon as he was done with all the traveling he made nine trips all together! He made more trips than any Seagoing Cowboy!

Later on Luke kept working with all the animals. All the taking care of made Luke very busy, beside with the traveling. Luke also had to clean.

On Lukes second trip he served his night as a watchman. He had to check on all the animals every hour. But then a horrible thing happened. After making his hourly report to the captain, Luke slid down a slippery ladder on his backside. He landed feet first toward an opening on the side of the ship. A small strip of metel along the edge stopped his slide, that kept him from going overboard into the dark Alantic Ocean. But luckly for him he was still alive.

As soon as that insedant happened to Luke, he got his ribs cracked. Luke couldn't work for a couple of days. So while Luke was not going to work he managed his time to have fun on board. He played baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where animals have been housed. He played alot more games aswell.

Later on being a Seagoing Cowboy he thought of how amazing it feels to help people. He helped lots of people during his trips. So Luke had a great idea. He wanted people to help other people. He started to convince people to be a Seagoing Cowboy. But most of people thought he was crazy. He told people how amazing it is to be traveling and amazing it is to be helping others.

People called his job dangerouse. It sure was. Luke got very annoyed and angry because people thought he was crazy and they did not like that kind of job. Luke stopped persuading people to be a Seagoing Cowboy. But He didn't give up on his job though. He liked his job the way it is and he wouldn't change it for anything. He got awards for being a very helpful, admiring, and amazing person in his job.","

The passage also states that Luke holds the record for the most trips for a seagoing cowboy. What he is saying is that he is havig a lot of fun with this job, and wants others to have an opportunity to do the same.

In this story he states that he went to greece. I belive that this is a huge part, being able to do things like that. He says that he could go to China, and Europe on his extra time, and that he enjoyed going to those extra places.

In the passage it also states that he helped around the house as a young boy, and that helped him grow to be stronger, but not to the point of that of the sea, the dangerous sea. He also states that he was a night watchmen, and he checked the animals every hour.

He also says that one night he was sliding downa latter on his back side and almost fell off the ship. All though he couldn't work for a few days, he satses that he was very thankful to be alive.

He states that he also had time to have fun on board, such as playing simple games to help pass the time. he would do boxxing, fencing, reading, whittling, and table tennis.

I belive that being a seagoing cowboy would be a good idea for young boys for somthing to do for a while.","

F-cowboy20,"Luke is telling people to join. He wants more people. Luke is convincing people to join the Seagoing Cowboys program. He would see and adventure other places.

Another detail about Luke convincing people is to help him go to other places.

When he was going to graduate, soon his life would change. When it was 1945, they saw their seaman's paper. They headed to Greece. When luke turned 18. He could be draft to the military service. By the time he was dischared in 1947, Luke had made nine trips.

Another reason Luke would let you join is he would let u travel with him. It will be a good opportunity. He led international students and exchange visitors for many years. He said it might be difficult for him. It took him time to do everything. he had to check the animals for one hour. He was so tierd. On one night he was a night watchman. Luke had alot of bad days. He had to clean the ship. He was busy the whole time but he was ok because he had food to eat. it was fun for him.

Luke was a kind and brave person. He was really cool. I think he convinced a lot of people to join. It was really hard for him. He had to work and do stuff. He is a nice guy.","

""[Essay Content: Luke is telling people to join. He wants more people. Luke is convincing people to join the Seagoing Cowboys program. He would see and adventure other places.

Another detail about Luke convincing people is to help him go to other places.

When he was going to graduate, soon his life would change. When it was 1945, they saw their seaman's paper. They headed to Greece. When luke turned 18. He could be draft to the military service. By the time he was dischared in 1947, Luke had made nine trips.

Another reason Luke would let you join is he would let u travel with him. It will be a good opportunity. He led international students and exchange visitors for many years. He said it might be difficult for him. It took him time to do everything. he had to check the animals for one hour. He was so tierd. On one night he was a night watchman. Luke had alot of bad days. He had to clean the ship. He was busy the whole time but he was ok because he had food to eat. it was fun for him.

Luke was a kind and brave person. He was really cool. I think he convinced a lot of people to join. It was really hard for him. He had to work and do stuff. He is a nice guy.]""

When he turned 18 he wsa his way to Greece (as a Seagoing Cowboy) and he got draft. When they found out he was a Seagoing Cowboy they said he could do his service as a Seagoing Cowboy.

It opend up the world to him. He got to see the Acropolis in Greece and he rode up in Venic, Italy were the streets are water. Helping out on his Aunt's farm helped him for the hard work as a Seagoign Cowboy but it didn't help for the danger of the sea. It made him more awar of peole in other countries that need help and that stayed with him for life and he shared that wiht his family. He always said it was more than just an adventure.

Being a Seagoing Cowboy can be fun at times but can be realy hard at some parts. It helps for life like school does. I think that more peole sould get a try to become a Seagoing Cowboy just to learn soem of the same thing Luck did or see the things he might have seen. So give it a try it can be fun! ","

Luke knew that it was hard work, but he learned about all hard work on his aunt Katie's farm. This all changed his life, but for the better.

Luke has gone to his first trip for Greece. While he is there he finds beautiful landmarks such as when he saw the castle in Crete and the Panama Canal. He had explored Greece, and seen the Acropolis in Greece. Luke has also taken a gondola ride in Venice,Italy. Bomberger has also had much fun on these trips where he and the cowboys played games such as baseball and volleyball when there was empty holds from where the animals were housed. They would also have boxing, reading, fencing, whittling, and table-tennis tournaments. Luke and the other cowboys got a lot more expeirence working with animals, especially barnyard animals.

For Bomberger this has made him appreciate his life more. He has hosted many international students and exchange visitors for this reason. All of his overseas trips have taught him his value and how luck he is. The ""Seagoing Cowboys"" was more to him than an aventure. It was a life lesson.","

In this passage a Cowboy who rode the waves Luke was a seagoing cowboy. Luke Bomberger is his full name. There are many reasons why Luke Bomberger join the program to participate in the seagoing Cowboys. Luke was a awesome seagoing cowboy.

Luke also found time yo have fun on board, especially on return trips after the animals had been unloaded. Another reason he join the program, because he knew it was a opportunity of a lifetime. Luke help other countrys with thier needs and to provide food.

My second reason why he wanted to be a seagoing cowboy is because he wanted to help countrys animals, and be a great man. Luke claims that the cattle boat trips were an unbelievalbe opportunity for a small-town boy"", he says. Besides helping people Luke had the side benefit of seeing Europe and china.

My third and final reason is he made about 16 times he crossed the Alantic ocean,and pacific ocean twice.

F-cowboy37,"Luke Bomberger was a seagoing cowboy. He crossed the Atlantic Ocean 16 times and the Pacific twice to help people affected by world war ll. He took care of horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas.

Along his trip he got chance to visit many places. He had the benefit of seeing Europe and China. But to him seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special he also said that taking that gondola ride in Venice, Italy also was.

He fed and watered the animals and cleaned the stalls. Bales of hay and bags of oats had to be pulled from the lower holds of the ship and thats what Luke did. During the crossings caring for the animals kept Luke busy.

He was a watchman and had to look out on the animals every hour and report back to the captian. One day he was doing his normal rutien, and he had slid down a slippery ladder an his backside and when he slid a small strip of metal along the edge stopped his slide, kepping from falling overboard in the Atlantic ocean. Helping on his aunt Katie's farm when he was young had prepared luke for hard work.

In the story it tells you of a man named Luke Bomberger and what he did as a Seagoing Cowboy. It doesn't really try to convince you to participate in the program but if you do you can get some details from what he did to what you might do if you joined. After this program he said ""it made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs."" ","

F-cowboy38,"Luke Bomberher had no idea that his life would change soon after his high school graduation. He was working a two part-time jobs in a grocwry store and a bank when his friend Don Reist invited him to go to Europe on a cattle boat. Luke couldn't say no. He knew it was an opportunity of a lifetime.

When Luke and Don got there they were so happy. That is when Luke relized that he wanted to serve there.

Lukealso wanted to help. He says that seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special. That is one of the reasons why he wants to serve and help.

Helping out on Luke's aunt Katie's farm as a boy had prepared him for hard work, but not for the dangers at sea. On his second trip, Luke served as night watchman. His job was to check on all the animals every hour. One rainy night, after making his hourly report to the captain, he slid down a slipperu ladder on his backside. Likes heart raced as he shot feet first toward an opening on the side of the ship. He was safe.

Luke is now a Seagoing Cowboy snd is much more adventurous. It opened the eorld to him, and now Luke Bomberger is reslly happy.

Luke and his friend Don was planing on doing this together. Don invited him to go to Europe on a cattle boat, before he probaly wouldnt even had done it. Luke literaly almost died because he almost fell off board. Maybe if Don didnt tell him maybe he wouldnt never almost died on the cattle ship.

Luke said it was an adventure , it opened up a new world for him, he said ,"" I am grateful for his opportinity,"" he says,"" It made we aware of other people of other coutries and thier needs."" he said he was grateful for it he didnt think of it as just doing it because you have to he wanted to do, he saiid once in a lifetime oppuntity, he wanted to he wasn't pushed his choice. In Luke's point of view that was probaly the best choice of his life.

People sould do this because it could change ou for the better and worst. You would help people who need it. If you like animals you would be around animals all the time . You would notice he good an d bad thing in othe rcountries. Please sign up for this so you can help and serve your own country . Everything and everyone needs help around the world . So help,serve, and e helpful so other people could be happy]""

F-cowboy47,"When Luke was a little town boy he made a huge inprovment by becoming a

Seagoing Cowboy. He saw a lot of stuff on the boat as you can tell on paragraph 5 he said, ""Besides helping people,I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China."" That would be a great experince for a small town boy. I think it was a great idea to join the program because, you could tell your grandchildren about all the things you have seen and done. If his friend had not been there to tell him about it he would have been working two jobs his whole life. Luke is probably very greatful.

Luke is also the best there because he has went threw the route nine time as you see on paragraph 6. Luke point of veiw would probably tell more about what he saw during the trip and what he did. He loves to help people by this job he has helped bring all the cattle/food. Luke is very talented for having this job because you have to feed the animals about three times aday and keep them alive. You can state this information on paraghraph 6 and 7. He worked so much he got hurt and craked his ribs. He was happy to be alive. Therefore he had to stay at home to get better.

Luke's point of view would also tell how fun it was to work there and he would convince you that it is a realy good job. He was very happy to get this job beause he said, "" I'm grateful for the opportunity."" Luke created history and when he could not do the job any more people visited him all the time like students and many familys to live on all the history he made. It opened up Lukes world up when he got the job. Its also so cool how they played sports when they had free time to take the time away. Its amazing how he can get all those animals and pick them up on the boat and take them across the country and drop them off. He was realy good at his job to do that!

The plus is that when you travel to help others you get to see the ocens all the time and beautiful sights! It is an opportunity of a lifetime if you ask me! If I was old enough I might what to think about being a Seagoing Cowboy!

Luke's claim was a great claim! Instead of working in a grocey store and a bank he became a Seagoing Cowboy! Even himself he said, '' It opened a whole new world for me'' He helped animals and more when the World War Two happend. He recovered their food supplies. He went accrosed the Atlantic Ocean 16 times and the Pacific Ocean twice to help people affected by World War two, that would be a sight to see.

When you are a Seagoing Cowboy you have a responsibility to help animals and more! But it can also be dangerous crossing the oceans all the time. If you want to be a Seagoing cowboy you have to be brave and courageous! You need those traites because if that was your job you would'nt want to be nervous or afraid all the time.

Luke had too be brave he had to have a great outlook to kept doing what he was doing, And you can too! His point of veiw was strong. He went on 9 trips and that is the most of any Seagoing Cowboy! He also had a cargo of 355 horses plus enough hay and oats to feed them! He even cracked his ribs, but he is ok. Over something small but he was brave enough to keep going because he cared for the animals and he loved his job.

You should become a Seagoing Cowboy for sure! If you like animals and travling this is the job for you! You can have so much adventure you would'nt even know what to do with it! This generation needs to carry on with the Seagoing Cowboys! To help animals and more! One day we will need your help more than ever! We need this to keep going with the Seagoing Cowboys!

F-cowboy55,"Have you ever read the story A Cowboy who rode the waves? I know I have, it's a book about a boy who is invited to Europe and he becomes a Seagoing Cowboy after World War 2. This book includes being a Seagoing Cowboy, the Seagoing Cowboy has to take care of animals on a ship and a boy named Luke explores

First, the Seagoing Cowboy, a Seagoing Cowboy is a Cowboy who takes care of animals over sea or on a boat. The Seagoing Cowboy in the story was no different he took go care of the animals. Everyday he watered and fed the animals 2 to 3 times a day. When Luke first became a Seagoing Cowboy he knew it was going to be alot of hard work so he worked as hard as he could. I can infer that if Luke had not took good care of any of the animals they all would be dead.

Next, Luke Bomberger explores, in the story,it states that Luke visited Europe, China and he explored the Atlantic ocean. and also the text states that Luke also found time to have fun aboard the ship, especially on the return trips after the animals had been unloaded. I can infer that if I was a Seagoing Cowboy I would not survive working as hard as Luke did.

Last, Being a Seagoing Cowboy,by reading the text,being a Seagoing Cowboy is alot of work. In the text it says being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more than an adventure for Luke Bomberger. It opened the world to him. And in Luke's own words he said It made me more aware of people of other countries and thier needs. Also being a Seagoing Cowboy can be dangerous because when Luke was night watchman on a rainy night, he slipped on a ladder and cracked his ribs but thankfully he didn't fall in the Atlantic ocean because their was a small strip of metal along the edge of his side. I can infer that if that small metal strip was not there Luke would most likely be dead.

Now you know how the Seagoing Cowboys worked, how they took care of animals and how Luke explored. Now, if you want to achieve something like Luke did then get out there and show everyone that you can do what you dream to do.","

This program will be a opportunity of a lifetime. In the prompt it states that he couldn't say no to his friend, and that he knew it was a opportunity of a lifetime. Secondly Luke says ""The cattle-boat trips were an unbelievable for a small-town boy."" Besides helping others he likes to taking water rides Venice, Italy. Thrirdly Luke was able to tour excavated castle in Crete and Marveled. But mostly went there to spend time with his friend.

Luke didn't go to the program he went there to see his friend. First he gets a phone call from his friend saying ""Hey would you like to come over to Europe then asked about cattle boating. His friend Don Reist confnced him to come out and see him, but not only see him but to go cattle boating with him. But yet not only did Luke do the program and gets to hang out with his friends he gets to experence new thngs.

Luke was able to experence new things while on this trip, and learn some to. World war 2 was over in 1945. Luke was a watchman and he had to check on the animals every hour. Luke found time to have fun the cowboys would play volleyball, baseball, table tennis, and more.

In conclusion, I think Luke choose the right chose because he would still be doing the same thing being a cowboy and farming. Since he went cattle boating he's not the same in a good way. Also it was good to go see his friend and cattle boat with him to. These are my reasons why Luke should join.   ","

They had 335 horses and alot of hay and ats to feed them on the way to Greece. Luke and his friend Dan wanted to join the Seagoing Cowboys program because they could help all the animals that were shipped overseas and that were hurt. So Luke and Dan helped all of the animals and got the better. Luke was happy because he also got to see the Acropolis in

Greece and he also got to take a gondola ride in Venice.

When luke ws almost arriving in Greece he turned 18 which meant he could be drafted in the military services. When Luke's draft board learned that he was on a cattle-boat trip they said why don't you just keep doing that for his service.When Luke was part of the cattle-boat trip it was an unbelievable opportunity for someone like him. He said ""besides helping people he got to see Europe and China. The exciting part was that he got to go to Greece and see the Acropolis and go on the gondola ride in Venice.

Luke got a job as a night watchman. His job was to check on the animals at night time. When he had the job as a night watchmen he slid down the slippery slide on his backside and cracked some of his ribs so he couldn't do his job for a couple of days. Luke said ""it made him more aware of

Luke turned 18 before arriving in Greece that means he could of maybe joined military. Luke said it took about 2 weeks to travel across the Atlantic Ocean. It took a month to travel to china from united states. There lucky because they had 335 horses on the cargo ship with enough food and hay.

Luke had to take care of all the horses it was his job. It was no big deal though when he was a little kid his aunt made him work on her farm to be prepared. Just in case he did work in a farm in future and look he is taking care of animals. On Luke's second trip he was a night watchman. All he had to do was check on the animals every single hour.

Luke loved being a Seagoing cowboy it was more than he ever wanted. He had some scary moments but you have to face some fear. He was very scared when he almost fell off a cargo ship but a metal peice saved his life. Luke would find some time to have his own time and talked to the animals.","

F-cowboy64,"Today we will be talking about the story ""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves."" So sit back in your chair, and prepare to get lost your mind. Veiwer beware you might just learn somthing new.

In this paragraph will be talking about the young man on his way to eroup Luke Bomberger. Some people say that it was dangerous but I say he did a heroic act by bring cattle and horses to war torn countries. Now we think why he did that for so long, it wasent money, fame, or even for himself. No he did that selfless act for those people who had nothing left after war war 2. If you ask thats why he did it to help those women, men, and children, of china germany italy and all sorts of places that were left in ruins.

In this paragraph will be talking about Luke's claims. Such as he knew it was an opprotunity of a life time. That is supported by parts of the story were he may have to work but has fun in between his hard work. Like when in italy he visits such places like Crete or the Acropolis. There were also bad times like when he fell of that slipery ladder and broke some of his ribs in a storm and almost fell over board if it wasent for a small metal bar holding him in.

For a second lets talk about the time he spent overseas. We look at the fun he had in his nine adventures. Such as when he first visted Greece. He went to the Acropolis, soon after he visited the Panama Canal. Those were just some of the places that he got to travel not includeing Venice or Crete or even China.

In the end all you can say about Luke Bombriger is that he tried to help people. He was so selfless that even broken ribs couldnt stop him form doing whats right. There are only words that can discribe his charachter, selfless, kind harted. The number one thing you can call him this and simply this human.","

F-cowboy68,"My argument about Lukes point of view is that in paragraph four it show that Luke had made nine trips, so Luke tavels to a lot of different places. Luke had traveled to the eastern coast to get to China. Luke would want others to participate in Seagoing Cowboys program to teach what Luke does when he is a seagoing cowboy.

The article shows that Luke adventures lot sof things when he is a seagoing cowboy he ahd to take care of animals when he was a seagoing cowboy, such as a horse and a cow. Luke and his friend Don signed up to probably or most likely show that Luke was a good seagoing cowboy. Luke had crossed the Atlantic Ocean 16 times that had affected by World War two.

Details from the article that supports Lukes claims is Luke always helped other animals that had was showed in the passage. I think others would join Lukes program because he is a grateful person that shows that Luke is grateful in the passage. Luke had showed that Luke was a grateful person is, in the passage it says ''Caring for animals during the crossings kept Luke busy''.

I think that Luke loves being a seagoing cowboy because in the passage it shows that Luke loves being a seagoing cowboy. Luke showed that he wanted to help others and animals as he would want to start a program. Luke had toured an excavated castle in crete and maeveled at the Panama Canal on his way to China. I think he liked China as the best tour that he probably been on before, because he talked a lot about China in the passage about where different parts in China that he had been to that had been stated in the passage. The conclusion is that Luke is a good seagoing cowboy that was showed in the passage. And he loves that he is doing in the passage i think, he likes caring for other animals that were in the passage that it was stated in the passage.      ","

F-cowboy69,"From Luke's experieance he know's that he is lucky to life in america. And that other people in other countires don't get a chance to live a good life. So Luke let people from other places stay at his home so they could go to a good school. And that awarness stayed with him for the rest of his days. Like he said it was an opportunity of a life time.

Luke had just graduated from high school and was working 2 part time jobs. One at the bank. One at the grocery. Untill one day his friend Don Reist came along and asked him to be a ""Seagoing Cowboy"" with him. He knew this was the oppertunity of a life time. So obivisly he went.

In August 1995, World War ll was over in Europe, many countries were gone. So luke and the other Seagoing Cowboys were sent there with food, animals, and more. Luke and his friend were shiped over seas to help as part of the UNRRA. He was shocked to see all the countries ruined. There was nothing left!

After all of that he was shiped to China with lots of suplies. One his way he got to see ols castles. He also traveled down the Panama Canal. The aniamls keep Luke very busy. They needed to be feed 3 times a day. They played lots of ball games to pass the time. Like volleyball and table tennis.

Being a

Seagoing Cowboy was much more than an adventure to Bomberger. On all over his nine missions he learned that he was very lucky. LIke he said,""It made me more aware of people of other countries and thier needs."" And the awareness stayed with him, he became a host for international students and exchage visitors for many years. That oppertunity chaged Luke Bomberger's live forever!

He saw many beautiful places and met many interesting people, as such he would recommend the program to somebody. In the following paraghraphs I will present luke's arguement and hopefully convince you to join ""The Sea Going Cowboys.

Luke starts his story as a young boy [fresh out of high school] working at a grocery store and a bank, when his friend Don Reist invited him to work on a cattle boat with him. He accepted and went off on the cattle boat bound for europe. Luke seems to have had fun working with the 335 horses on their first trip to europe and before arriving in Greece, luke turned 18. As such he was drafted.

Luke was told just to continue working on the boat for his servince so he spent another two years working on the boat. He says that he helped alot of people in China and Europe but he also got the benifit of seeing wonderful sights and places; like the Panama Canal and Acropolis or Venice. He says that aside from his adventures he learned of how lucky he is to have things like food and a job when people in the countries he visited were much less fortunate.

Enough about all this seriousness, let's talk about the fun activities on the ship. Luke said that the men on-board played all kinds of games like Base-ball and volleyball in empty holds when the animals were gone. The men also enjoy games like boxing fencing and best of all, reading; the men also had tournaments for table tennis.

So, in short you get paid for working a third of the time, exploring foreign countries the second third of the time and playing games the last third of the time. There's no other way to describe it other than ""Best job ever."" ","

My first reason that shows that Luke is maybe trying to bring more people to work with him is that in the whole script he only comes across one problem but everything else is great which is hard to believe because in the sea there could be storms ,waves,floods or leaks on the boat but surprisingly he never comes across any of those problems which is odd.

My second reason that shows that Luke is just trying to bring people into the business is in the text it said that Luke kept on saying that he got to ride gondola in the streets of water in Spain,and got to excavate a castle in create , and even got to see the Panama Canal on his way to China so he is basically saying that all of the things he did where fun he got to go siht seeing but not everything he did could of been fun he also had to feed animals and clean stables so not every thing he did was fun.

F-cowboy82,"People should join the program because the Seaagoing cobows are trying to fight the country and end WW2. But after the war you could do fun things. Luke's inventor was fun because he got to travel.

Luke's claim is its alright to be Seagoing Cowboy is fun but sometimes it just feels good to be still alive after the war. Seagoing cowboys are trying to help other people to get food so they can survive.

The Sea going Cowboys are good for the world because they save people's life.

Luke had made 9 trips over the world and the most of any Seagoing Cowboy. Sea going Cowboys ride on cattle-boat so they can go around the world. The Seagoing Cowboys help 44 nations to joind together to make the UNRRA.

My conclusion is people should join the Seagoing Cowboys because they help people and 44 nation joind together to make the UNRRA.The Seagoing Cowboys ended WW2 and they traveled 9 trips with cattle-boat to get around. Luke is a good Seagoing Cowboy because he helps his aunt Katies farmas a boy. But being a Seagoing Cowboy was muc more o an aventure for Luke Bomberger. Lukke also found fun oplaying baseball,table tennis,fencing and boxing.   ","

F-cowboy83,Well in the Seagoing Cowboys program i think people and plus they get to travel on a boat. Reason why i would join it is because when they get to travel around and they can see things like animals and so that i can play with the animals. If u were a small time boy just like Luke Bomberger you could have a unbelievable trip. The trips were amazing also but the one that standed out to me was the cattle-boat trips. It took two whole week to cross the Atlantic Sea. Luke Bomberger had a job as a watchmen once and it didnt go to well he. He was supposed to check on the animals every hour he was going to cheack on theam when he flew and he broke his ribs. But most importantly of all it opened up the world to Luke Bomberger he said he is grateful for this opportunity. It made him be more aware of people. He hosted a number of international students and exchanged visitors for many of years to tell him about his job.,"

F-cowboy84,"My argument about Lukes point of view is that you should always try soething new or something you always wanted to do. In this story Luke is working at a store and his friend invited him to go on a cattle boat to Europe after World War 2. He knew this would be an opportunity of a lifetime. So he went.

You could see how he was feeling just by the way the author put it. He was exicited and he was ready. When Luke found out that he was to take care of horses, young cows, and mules he knew he would be good at it because he worked at his aunts farm. He thought this would be a good time to help out with this disaster. Luke went overseas just to do someting helpful for the problems people had. All the stuff people had were gone because of the World War 2.

He had some rough times on way, like running into storms, big waves and other stuff that happen in the ocean, but hey it was worth it. But some thingss got severe, when he broke his ribs during a storm. He took nine trips on the cattle boat. And this was big for him because he was a small - town boy. He also knew he was helping out thousands of people. Over seas, Luke was very busy with the animals. He had to feed them 2 to 3 times a day. Thats a lot of work for young boy.

Just by reading this article you can tell how much work you will have but your doing it for people who can't do this stuff. So what, it may be hard, it may be boring, but those people need your help. Thats why you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program. Luke was brave enough to do this kind of thing just because of 1 thing, he had faith in him, his best friend, and the people. Im pretty sure your going to have a warm welcoming home surprise waiting for you at your place. Im entirely sure that all of you want that surprise. Just join the Seagoing Cowboys program and your garenteed and fun active time with the people you are working with and the peoeple that need your help. So have the faith Luke had, and come on down and sign up for Seagoing Cowboys program. Hope to see you there cowboy.

Oh and one more thing, have some faith in yourself, it always turns out good. Just ask Luke Bomberger, he will tell you about all that happen just with a lot of faith and courage.","

F-cowboy85,"It could be a opportunity of a lifetime to travel over sea's and be a Seagoing cowboy. It can lead your family to host a number of international student to help educate them in learning like school for them. You can help people with their needs and other countries that suffer without food or water. Being a Seagoing cowboy can lead to many different adventures in life.

Luke said for being a Seagoing Cowboy he lead his family to host lots of international students and exchange visitors for many years. He overthought about going too but he just couldn't just skip this opportunity of a lifetime. He also didn't know his life would change really quick right after high school graduation. World War II was over in Europe and many countries were left in pieces.

Luke was very suprised about going over sea's.

It took him about two weeks for him to cross the Alantic ocean. It also took him a month to get to China because he was so far away from China. He has helped out his Aunt Katie's farm as a boy. Which had made him brave enough to cross the oceans just him and some other people on board of the ship or boat.

That's why I think Luke should presuade other people to join the Seagoing Cowboys. It would be a great opportunity for them. They would get to experience and see some really good, beautiful things out there. There might be some slips and falls but they would probably be fine like Luke did he fell and sliped up he ended up being fine.","

F-cowboy86,"Luke is trying to convice people to be in the Seagoing Cowboys program by saying cool things that he does. For example: he is saying that he toured an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on his way to china. He also said that he finds time to have fun on board. some games they played were baseball, vollyball, Table tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, and whittling.

Luke got to vist different places and he got to go to 16 different places. Luke also got to go to the Atlantic Ocean. Luke also liked to see the animals. He would always go visit the animals and feed them. Another thing luke would do is help people that got hurt during the War.

So those are a lot of fun things that luke did. He also did a lot of good things. Like feed animals, take them from one place to another, and help people that got hurt in the War. Luke shared all those fun and good things that he did to convice others to participate the Seagoing Cowboys program.

F-cowboy88,"A good reason to join the program was that the cattle-boat trips were an unbielievable opportunity for a small town boy. It was because besides helping people you get to see lots of stuff while in the process of doing these things like Europe and China.

Luke turned 18, he was old enough to be drafted into the military when Luke draft board learned that he was on cattle-boat trip, they told him to just keep doing that for his service. By the time he was discharged in 1947, Luke made nine trips and that was the most of any Seagoing Cowboy.

Luke got to explore the world, also found time to have fun aboard after they got all the animals out, they played stuff like Table-tennis, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and those games helped pass the time. Being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more than an adventure for Luke Bomberger. It opened up the world to him because he says that he's grateful for the opportunity to be a Seagoing Cowboy.

As he speaks he says it made him more aware of people of other countries and their expectations. That awareness stayed with him,leading his family to host a number of international students and exchange visitors for many years.   ","

F-cowboy90,"The United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration consists of,44 nations that came together to help countries recover their food supplies,animals and more.

They hired ""Seagoing Cowboys"" to take care of the horses,young cows,and mules that were shipped overseas.

Luke Bomberger and his friend Don Reist signed up.

Luke exclaimed that besides helping people,he got to see other countries,such as Greece,and Europe.

He also toured an excavated castle in Crete.

Luke had to take care of the animals daily,they had to be fed and watered two or three times a day.

Food and bales of hay had to be brought up from the lower holds of the ship,and stalls had to be cleaned.

Luke said that helping out on his aunt Katie's farm as a boy prepared him for hard work, but not for the dangers of the sea,on his second trip luke served as a watchman.

His job was to check on all of the animals every hour.

One time he said he slipped and fell on his backside and his heart raced as he shot feet first toward an opening side of the ship,thankfully a sharp peice of metal stopped his slide,or he would have flew overboard into the dark Atlantic.

He was happy to be alive,but he could not work for a couple of days due to cracked ribs.

Luke also found fun on board,especially on return trips.

When the animals had been unloaded,the cowboys played baseball and volleyball games in empty holds where animals had been housed. Table-tennis tournaments,fencing,boxing,reading,whittling,and games also helped pass the time.

F-cowboy92,"In the story ""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves"" Luke joins the Seagoing Cowboy program.

In this story it talks about what Luke does on his journey so, this is what were are going to talk about.

In paragraph 1 it says Luke's friend Don Reist invited Luke to go with him to the Seagoing Cowboy program and Luke did not turn the offer down because that was an opportunity of a lifetime.

In paragraph 4 it said that

Luke turned 18 before arriving in Greece, which ment he could be drafted for military service.

""When my drafy board learned that I was on a cattle-boat trip, they told me to just keep doing that for my service.""

By the time he was discharged in 1947, Luke made nine trips-the most of any Seagoing Cowboy.

In paragraph 5 there were some reasons he should join the Seagoing Cowboys, and it said ""The cattle-boat trips were an unbelievable opportunity for a small-town boy,"" he says.

""Besides helping people, I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China.

But seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special,""

he says. ""So was taking a Gondala ride in Venice, Italy, a city with streets of water.""

Luke also toured an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on his way to China.

In paragraph 7 the way Luke's claim supported the outcome of the story.

Helping out on his aunt Katie's farm as a boy had prepared Luke for hard work, but not for the dangers at sea.

On his second trip, Luke served as night watchman.

His job was to check on all the animals every hour.

One rainy night, after making his hourly report to the captain, he slid down a slippery ladder on his backside.

Luke's heart raced as he shot feet first toward an opening on the side of the ship.

A small strip of metal along the edge stopped his slide, keeping him from flying overboard into the dark Atlantic.

He was happy to be alive.

But he could not work for a couple days because of cracked ribs.

My conclusion of the story is in paragraph 9 when it says, But being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more than an adventure for Luke Bomberger.

It opened up the world to him.

""I am grateful for the opportunity,"" he says.

""It made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs.""

And that awareness stayed with him, leading his family to host a number of international students and exchange visitors for many years.","

The Seagoing Cowboys helped take care of cows,hores, and mules that where over seas. Luke was 18 before arriving in Greece, that ment he could sing up for miliary service. He was on his cattle-boat trip when he signe u for the miliary. They had plenty of food and water to feed the anmials and themselves.

When you are a Seagoing Cowboy you get to travel a lot of places. Luck had been on 19 trips before they discharged him in 1947. If you like traveling then this is for you.

F-cowboy96,"The seagoing cowboy's sounds like a great program.

You get to see new and diffrent things when your in it.

You also get to go on a long ship/ boat ride.

If i were a boy i'd love to do the seagoing cowboy's program.

You may not but we all have our own opinion's.

What he did was very nice, and put himself in a great spot in life.

He didn't only help himself he helped others.

Luke sounds happy and that's what most people want at least that's what i want, so if you like seeing new and bueatiful things you'll want to do this.

Luke didn't really have a choice. He had no idea that his life would change when he graduatated from high school.

He was working two part-time jobs in a grocery store and a bank when his friend Don Reist invited him to go with him to Europe on a cattle boat. He couldn't say no, he knew it was a opportunity of a lifetime.

Luke is intersting he didn't want his life to go where it was going but if you do the right and great things. The right and great things will come back to you.

And that is what happened to Luke he was doing the right thing and one or two will or did come right back.

They did have to fight for there country but it wasn't just there's it was for others also.

This was a very imformational artice about if you do the right thing it comes right back, and if you can also in this article it did.","

Luke became a Seagoing Coyboy after his high school graduation. The reason he joined was because his freind Don invited him to go with him on a cattle boat to Europe. Luke didn't disagree because he knew it would be a opportunity of a lifetime.

If you were to join the Seagoing Cowboys you would be a part of a very important program. 44 nations united to help the contries in ruins after World War 11. The Seagoing Cowboys shipped the animals to help the countries regain their food supplies, animals and other things that the countries needed.

Being one of the Cowboys didn't mean it was all work and no play. During the trips across the oceans you can see China, Greece, and other contries you've probaly never seen before. After a hard days work of cleannig stalls and feeding animals you could play baseball and volleyball in the holds where the animals were kept. Games like fencing, boxing, and table-tennis also kept the Cowboys ocupied.

There are dangers that come with this important job. Luke was a watchman on his second trip. His job was to check on the animals every hour. After he made his report to the captian he slipped on a ladder, slick with rain, and started to fall twards the Atlantic. A piece of metal stopped his fall but he couldn't work because he cracked a few ribs.

You should become a Seagoing Cowboy. It includes great sights, fun, and hard work. If you become a part of the Seagoing Cowboys you are a part of a great program that saves lives. The job is full of suprises and danger, but it is all worth it because you are helping others.","

F-cowboy100,"Luke had no idea that his life would change so soon after his high school graduation. He was working two part-time jobs in agrocey store and a bank when his friend Don invited him to go to Europe on a cattle boat. Luke couldn't say no.

In 1945, World War 2 was over in Europe,and manu countries were left ruins. To help these countries recover their food and supplies,animals, and more, 44 nations joined together to help the nation they are called the Seagoing Cowboys to take care of the horses, young cows, and mules that were shiped overseas.

By the time he was discharged in 1947,Luke had made nine trips-the most of any Seagoing Cowboy. I had the side benifit of seeing Europe and China. But seeing the Acroplis in Greece was special,he says. So taking a gondola ride in Venice,Italy,a city with streets of water. A cargo of 335 horses plus enough hay and oats to feed them.

It took two weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the eatern coast of the United States and a month to get to china. Caring for animals during the crossings kept Luke busy. They fed the animals three times a day water,bales of hay,and bags of oats. Stalls had to be cleaned.

Being a Seagoing cow was much more than an adventure for Luke. It opened up the world to him. ""Im grateful for the opportunity,""he says. It made him more aware of people of other countries and their needs.

F-cowboy102,"So when Luke came back to China he saw even more homeless people than before. So he thought he would have to make a change to that.

So when he was setting up a program for conviencing people to help the homeless Don tried to call and have him come to America and and Luke said, ""Don, I can't I have to help the people in China because I see little kids and grown people starving on the street and that hurts me."" So then when he had it set up a lot of people came to support it and Luke convienced a lot of people, but also a lot of people not to help. So the applications to sign up there was a fee of ten dollars to help with the grocceries and that was why even more people did not join him.

So when he saw a lot of people without forms he stopped everybody and had a long speech about helping the poor and imagine if you were in their shoes and telling them they didn't want to be like that. So then almost all the people clapped and then walked in and got a form and asked him where to start. He said,"" Just if you see a homeless person, help him out.

Your student, Emily, submitted the following essay and she is talking about the dream of becoming a cowboy:

""[Essay Content: So when Luke came back to China he saw even more homeless people than before. So he thought he would have to make a change to that.

So when he was setting up a program for conviencing people to help the homeless Don tried to call and have him come to America and and Luke said, ""Don, I can't I have to help the people in China because I see little kids and grown people starving on the street and that hurts me."" So then when he had it set up a lot of people came to support it and Luke convienced a lot of people, but also a lot of people not to help. So the applications to sign up there was a fee of ten dollars to help with the grocceries and that was why even more people did not join him.

So when he saw a lot of people without forms he stopped everybody and had a long speech about helping the poor and imagine if you were in their shoes and telling them they didn't want to be like that. So then almost all the people clapped and then walked in and got a form and asked him where to start. He said,"" Just if you see a homeless person, help him out. So then after he rode his boat to America and helped Don out he came back to China to see how his SeaGoing Cowboys program was going.

When he came to China he was very happy of how everybody had a house and job and nobody was starving. So he set up a meeting and thanked everybody who supported that program and told them they did a wonderful job and he almost cired of how much he was happy.

F-cowboy104,"You should join the Seagoing Cowboys program. The cattle-boat trips are an unbeliveable opportunity for a small-town boy. Besides helping people, Luke had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China. But when Luke went to see the Acropoils in Greece he said it was specail. He also said that gondola ride in Venice, Italy, a city with streets of water.

Luke also found fun time on board, especially on return trips after the animals had been unloaded. The cowboys would have so much fun the would play baseball and volleyball in empty holds where animals had been housed. Table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and games also helped pass time.

You should join the Seagoing Cowboys program because you can have a lot of fun there its fun, helpful to people, entertainig you if you are bored and its cool and it has a lot of space. You can save people and animals. You can save the person if they are drowning by your boat or you can save an animals if they fall of your boat.

But being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more than an adventure for Luke Bomberger. Luke said it opended up the world to him he said he is grateful for the opportunity. It made him more aware of people of other countries and there needs. That aware stayed with him, leading his family to host a number of international students and exchange visitors for many years.

Helping out his aunt Katie's farm as a boy had prepared Luke for hard work, but not for the dangers at sea. On his second trip, Luke served as night watchman. His job was to check on all the animals every hour. One rainy night,after making his hourly report to the captain, he slide down a slippery ladder on his backside.

For instance,in the story he even says that he knew it was an opportunity of a lifetime. Now tell me that doesn't sound like he knew it was going to be great experence for him and it could be a great experence for you.

Another example is in the last paragraph when he said that he was gretful for the opportunity to be a Seagoiong Cowboy. Now i'm just stating the facts to to you that he is trying to convience people to be a Seagoing Cowboy and if your not agreeing with me yet then I guess there's no way of convincing you.

I have another piece of evidence since you still don't believe me. He also says that Luke also had fun on board. This piece of evidence just proves that he had a good time just being on the boat.

In conclusion, I truly think that in this passage he was trying to convince others to participate in the Seagoing Cowboy program and Ithink that you should believe that to. I gave you my evidence and my reasoning why I think this and if you read my evidence you should to.","

F-cowboy112,"Luck Bomberger was working two part-time jobs in a grocery store and a bank. Don Reist his friend invited him to go to Europe on a cattle boat.

He said yes right then he knew it was an opportunity of a lifetime.

UNRRA hired ""Seagoing Cowboys"" to take care of the horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas.

Luke signed up with his friend Don.

Before arriving in Greece, Luke turned 18 years old, which meant he could be drafted for military service.

When his draft board learned he was on a cattle-boat trip, they told him to keep doing that for his service.

By the time he was discharged in 1947, he had made 9 trips the most of any Seagoing Cowboy.

The cattle boat trips were an unbelievable opportunity for Luke.

Besides helping people, he had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China.

But seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special.

Luke toured an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on his way to China.

It took about two weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern coast of the United States and a month to get to China.

Caring for the animals during the crossings kept him busy.

They had to be fed and watered two or three times a day.

Bales of hay and bags of oats had to be pulled up from the lower holds of the ship.

Stalls had to be cleaned.

Helping out on his aunt Katie's farm as a boy had prepared him for hard work, but not for dangers at sea.

He couldn't work for a couple of days because of cracked ribs.

Being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more than an adventure for Luke.

It opened the world up to him.

He is grateful for the opportunity.

F-cowboy113,"In the story ""A Cowboy Who Rides the Waves"" a young adult named Luke signs up for a program that is called the ""Seagoing Cowboys"" that take care of horses, young cows, and mules. The Seagoing Cowboys do this because countries that were destroyed need them for travel and food. Now here are three reasons why Luke decided to join the Seagoing Cowboys.

Luke signed up for the Seagoing Cowboys because it was an opportunity of a life time. That means that he would not get anymore chances to travel on a boat around the world. This is also a big opportunity mostly because he is a farm boy from a small town. In paragraph 5 and 1 it states ""... Luke couldn't say no. He knew it was an opportunity of a lifetime."" ""The cattle-boat trips were an unbeliveable opportunity for a small-town boy, but besides helping people, I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China..."" Also Luke wanted to join because he got to help countries that were damaged from the war. In the two sentences that were right before the first paragraph (the ones that help explain the story a little bit) it states "" Luke Bomberger crossed the Atlantic Ocean 16 times and the Pacific Ocean twice to help people affected by World War II (or WWII for short).""

The last reason that Luke joined the Seagoing Cowboys was because he got to be with animals. In paragraph 7 it states "" Helping out on his aunt Katie's farm had prepared Luke for the hard work..."" So that means that if he worked on a farm with a lot of animals, and he joins something with animals, that means he likes animals. Also in paragraph 1 it states "" ... Don Reist invited him to go to Europe on a cattle boat."" So that would mean that he wants to travel with animals in a baot or he wants to be in a boat filled with animals because he like animals (this story is kind of reminding me about Noah's Arch, you know the one with the boat filled with animals because there was a giant flood).

So those are the reasons why Luke desided to join the Seagoing Cowboys. Remember he joined because he wanted to help countries that were damaged or destroyed in the World War II, it was an opportunity of a lifetime for him because he is a farm boy, and because he got to be with animals. That is why Luke joined the program.","

Table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and games also helped pass time."" Before all of that Luke and the crew took care of the horses, young cows, and mules that were shiped overseas. When Luke and his friend Don they were sent right to work. Luke was a little ahead of him self becaus he helped out his aunt Katie on her farm as a boy , but his chalang was the dangerous seas.

Now Luke was in his early 20s and he was on his second night of wachman job, that ment that Luke had to check the animals every hour. It was a rainy night ,he was making his hourly report to the captin. on his way down he sliped down aladder on his back. Luke shot feet first to an opening on one side of the boat but a small strip of metal stoped him from falling into the dark, cold,tarorizing Atlantic.

He had crackend a couple of his ribs. In Lukes life time Luke had made nine trips the most of any Seagoing Cowboy.

Being Sea going Cowboy is much more Than a great time its an opportunity for you it giving you achance to see the word, and it shows you how much we are given in are country than other people around the world.

That awareness stays with you forever like it did with Luke Bomberger. After you do this you can tell stundents and others about what you did to help others ,and you might even make an impact on others. For being in his 20ntys Luke was a smart young man for what he did.

F-cowboy124,"I think you should join and participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program. If you like helping others this would be a good thing for you to do. Why would u want to go? You would probably want to join because you get to help people affected by the World War II. You also ge to help out animals like horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas. Who doesn't like that?

Many countries were left to ruins in Europe, so to help them the UNRRA hired Seagoing Cowboys to take care of things. It was a big opportunity! One of the Seagoing Cowboys, Luke, said that he liked helping the animals on the ship. He loved taking care of the horses and young cows they had. He mentioned that he also enjoyed taking care of the people in need, it made him feel good! He also said he is really grateful he got to have the Oppurtunity of his lifetime!

If u would like to do any of these things I mentioned in this paragraph then being in the Seagoing Cowboys program would be perfect for you. But these are only a few reasons why you could or wanted to join.","

F-cowboy125,"Luke Bomberger had a friend who asked him to tour Europe with him, he knew he couldn't turn it down.

World War II had just been in Europe, but was now over. Many comturies were left in ruins. These contries needed animals and livestock to survive. The UNRRA hired seagoing cowboys to take care of the livestock on the boats when they were being shipped to a certain part of the world to another. Luke and his friend wanted to care and help, so they signed up for seagoing cowboys program.

Luke had turned 18 upon the first trip, which meant he could be drafted for the army. His draft amnagement company had learned he was in the seagoing cowboys, and they told him to keep doing what he was doing, because it was a form of help.

Sometimesthe weather was bad upon the boats, and sometimes it was good. When it was bad, members upon the boat would participate in watching the storms. One night Luke had watch, he got into a bad accident that left him without work for a couple days due to broken ribs. When the weather was good, and all the chores were done for the day, the men upon the ship had time to play games or travel to see things. The animals are what kept Luke busy though.

When Luke had quit the seagoing cowboys, he had successfully completed nine trips, the most trips a seagoing cowboy has ever done, delivering animals to people in need of them.","

Today, he would encourage more people to join the Seagoing Cowboys program because it is a very great thing to do and you can travel and visit many places you have never visited before.

When he was doing the job, Bomberer visited several places including, China, Europe, Greece, Italy, Crete, and Panama. Out of them all, Greece was the most special to him.

Luke knew what an amazing offer it was from the beginning and he knew he couldn't turn it down. And he would encourge you to join because if you ever thought abut joining the military they would accept you and let you serve by being a Seagoing Cowboy.

In conclusion, you should become a Seagoing Cowboy because it gives you opporunities, palces to travel to, experiencences , other jobs, and different culturers to endure and discover and make you a person who has seen and done amazing things that other people cant say they have done.

Luke knew this was a once in a life time opportunity. Luke had said yes and at that moment he had just began an amazing adventure.

Luke had a very good experience that might have inspired the reader to do the same things. Luke was not only traveling in a boat to Europe but, he was also helping people get back to good shape because, world war 2 had just ended leaving them in bad shape. Students should be inspired because, Luke was helping people get back in good shape. People might also convinced to do the same thing Luke did.

Luke was having a lot of fun traveling around the world on a cattle ship. Luke knew this was an amazing opportunity in his life. Lukke himself had said that this was an amazing opportunity for a small town boy. He saw so many amazing things in the places he went. Luke had mentioned that he had been to Europe, China and Greece.

As Luke was on that cattle ship, he was helping people around the world get back to good shape, he was helping society. He was also bonding with animals, he was taking good care of animals. Most importantly it seemed like Luke was learning about the world and animals on this experience. Luke was experiencing how hard work felt. Luke, was really busy as they were crossing the Atlantic Ocean. He had to care of the animals by, feeding them, also giving them water and cleaning their stalls.

On his 2nd trip though he did have a diffcult time because, on a rainy night Luke was put as a watchman. He was supposed to check on the animals every hour. He had slipped down the ladder and got hurt. Because he couldn't work for a while, Luke found some ways to have fun on the ship. He and his friends played baseball and volleyball where the animals had stayed. After Luke had been discharged in 1947, Luke had made 9 trips(the most out of all seagoing cowboys!)

Luke knew what he was doing was a great cause, but did he know that going across the Atlantic and the Pacific oceans was a very risky thing. Luke could have had second thoughts about the risks that he was taking, but he wasn't doing it for himself, he was doing it for the people that needed his help.        ]""

Why i think that because they get to see alot of different things they never seen before. Also in the passage is states that Luke also found time to have fun on board, especially on return trips after the animals had been uploaded.

They headed for Greece with a cargo of 335 horses plus enough hay and oats to feed them.Luke turned 18 before arriving in Greece which ment he could be drafted for military service. By the time Luke was discharge in 1947,Luke had made nine trips- the most of any seagoing cowboy.

F-cowboy141,"The Seagoing Cowboys, which included Luke Bomberger, had helped many people due to the effect of the Word War II. The Cowboys were known to help others, beat records from past Seagoing Cowboys, and meeting new people.

The Cowboys were a huge help after Word War II. They joined with 43 other nations to form UNRRA (The United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administratation), which was to help countries recover animals, food suplies, and more. The UNRRA also hired the ""Seagoing Cowboys"" to take care of the young cows, mules, and horses that were shipped overseas.

When joining any club or, for example, the ""Seagoing Cowboys"", records are to be broken. When Luke was 18, he had made nine trips, which was the most any Cowboy has made. This was a big acomplishment for him, because it showed everybody what he could do.

Entering a club is a chance to meet new people. For example, when all the animals were unloaded, it was time to bring out your game side. Luke and the cowboys would play baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where the animals had been housed.

Joining the Seagoing Cowboys is a wonderful experience, because you have the oppertunity to see new places, help others in need, and of course meet new people. The cowboys are more than just Seagoing Cowboys, their people helping people.                        ","

He got to see unique things, participate in the recovery of other countries during the war, and it impacted his life forever. Other people who want to help the world should definitely participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program.

The first reason why other people should participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program is because they would get to help recover other countries from the war.

The text states, by the time he was discharged in 1947, Luke had made nine trips-the most of any Seagoing Cowboy. On all of those trips, Luke was helping deliver cattle to other countries to recover their food and animal supply. Many countries were in ruins and they needed the help that the Seagoing Cowboys provided.

Next, more people should participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program because they would get to see and visit many unique and interesting places around the world. The text states, Luke was able to see the Acropolis in Greece. The text also states, on his many trips, Luke got to take a gondola ride in Venice, Italy. Luke also toured an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on his way to China.

Finally, others should participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program because it will change their lives. The text states, after his great adventures as a Seagoing Cowboy, Luke's family was lead to host a number of international students for many years. The text also states, this experience opened up the world to Luke. Luke also got to bond with new people on board the SS Charles W. Wooster. He got to spend lots of time with them including times of playing volleyball, baseball, fencing, and many more activities to help pass time.

F-cowboy148,"In this passage you have heard about the Seagoing Cowboys and what they are and what they do. If you had to choose what would you choose do you think that is was right for Luke to convince others to participate in th Seagoing Cowboys program.

First, for some people some might think that Luke can convince other to join and I am on their side because if he is't able to convince people that how was he able to convince his friend to go with him. He could have just gone by himself and been selfish but he didn't want to be alone and wanted to be nice to his friend and asked him to come because he new that would have beeen the right thing to do. Luke was just trying be kind and nice ""He knew it was an opportunity of a lifetime."" Luke and his friend Don new that after all that time they didn't have to work two part jobs.

On the other hand, some might think that he shouldn't have to convince others to do that if he has to convince them than they really don't want to go. To some it might not have been a lifetime dream for some people or it might not have been a once in a lifetime opportunity. People are different and some are selfish so some might have thought that he really wasn't serious. So for some people they don't think that she should convince peopele to participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program.

To wrap this all up, what I think Luke's point of view on convincing others to participate in thye Seagoing

Cowboys program that he should convince other so go and help because it is the right thing to do. Some think that he shouldn't convince people to go. But at the end of the day everybody is different and everybody think differently so what every you think it is up to you.,","

F-cowboy150,"The Seagoing Cowboys is a great program, but being one is better. The cowboys go to fun places like China and Europe. But it is also a lot of hard work too, Luke had to care for the animals during crossings, the animals had to be fed and watered two to three times a day, bales of hay and bags of oats had to be pulled up from the lower holds of the ship.

After the animas had been unloaded the cowboys would had some freetime to play volleyball and baseball. They also play table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing to help pass the time. When they have a long trip and a lot of freetime they visit places, like when Luke toured an excavated castle in Crete, and marveled at the Panama Canal on his way to China.

Seagoing Cowboys could go basically anywhere. They went to China, Europe, Greece, and Crete. At the age of 18 Luke could be drafted for military service, but since he was on a cattle-boat trip, they told him he could do that for his service. So if your a Seagoing Cowboy it counts as being in the military service.

My conclusion is being a Seagoing Cowboy can ""open someones eyes"" to the needs of animals. Like Luke said, ""It made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs."" Seagoing Cowboys are very persistent, and if you like animals you should join this program. Because when Luke fell and slid on the ship, he almost fell off because he was helping the animals. And when Luke cracked his ribs on the ship, he didn't quit, he kept being a Seagoing Cowboy, and continued to help the animals. The Seagoing Cowboys care more about the animals than they do themselves, and that is great. Because it might be hard work but the animals need all the help they can get.","

Trips, yes trips Luke went to several places he went to Europe and China. Also, went to Venice and got to ride the gondola ride he even seen a castle in Crete he thought it was beautuful. Ah forget he went to Panama Canal too, well I dont know what that is but seems intresting though.

Seagoing Cowboy, it was alot of work but it turned out really fun. Luke said it was more then a adventure. A opportunity to try something new and helping other and spending the with new friends. Saying yes was good after all.

So i hope you liked it how Luke had a awesome time. Thinking it wouldn't be good after graduation but well it did. So thank you for reading hope it put intrest on your face.      ]""

F-cowboy157,"Luke said he grew up on an farm with his aunt so he wanted to help the animals. After World War 2 Luke wanted to help the countries recover by bringing food supplies and animals. Luke loved animals because when he was younger he had lived on a farm. So when he heard UNRRA is hirring Seagoing Cowboys to take care of Horses,Cows,and Mules he and his friend Don signed up. This to Luke this was an opportunity of a life time.

Luke got on an boat called SS Charles W. Wooster and there were 335 Horses plus hay and oats to feed the Horses. When Luke was 18 he could be drafted to be in the military but when they heard he was on a cattle boat trip they told Luke to stay. In 1947 Luke made nine trips the most out of any Seagoing Cowboy. Luke said ""Besides helping people, I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China. But seeing the Acropoils in Greece was special,""he says.

If you get to go on this trip you would be busy but you would have so much fun. Also if you like caring for people and animals you would be perfect for this journey. Another reason is if you like travling on a boat and don't get sea sick you should try being a Seagoing Cowboy or girl. Not only that but you could become famous just for helping people. Then again you should always help people. Luke went would you?                 ","

F-cowboy160,"Peaple should join this program because you will learn about what the passage is about and write what you think its about. So,Luke was a cowboy that rode over seas. He rode the Pacific Ocean 18 times. No one's ever rode the Pacific 18 times. He started ride the seas in August,1945. When he was heading for greece he was 18 years old.

So,I think he rode the Pacific 18 because that was how old he was turning. But it wasn't that he wanted to ride the seas he rode the seas because World War II in Europe so, I think Europe was is homeland. Luke had found many countries in some ruins. The countries were running out of food supplies so,since Luke was generous he gave them the food supplies they needed even animals. How nice was that of Luke. Luke wanted to help them more so he told them to get in the ship.

Luke was incredible he made nine trips. It took Luke to cross the Pacific two weeks. So,If you times the two weeks it took him to cross and eighteen times he crossed is thirty-six weeks to cross the eighteen times. The ate and drank water but they had to be fed twice a day or three times a day. They played basketball and volleyball. Where the animals were housed there was more games to play like table-tennis but only tournaments,fencing,boxing,reading,wittling,and other games. Being a seagoing cowboy was harder than having a adventure but thats Luke opinion.

Other peaple will have different opinions like adventures are better than being a seagoing cowboy,hating doing both,or not noing what a seagoin cowboy or a adventures does.","

F-cowboy161,"In this passage we see Luke's experience as a Seagoing Cowboy.

Luke shows us how being a Seagoing Cowboy gave him awareness for other people. He also shows us the many impotant things to learn from this job.

First, while being a Seagoing Cowboy Luke learned to take care of many of the animals.

He fed them and gave them water.

These actions, in turn, helped many people that were suffering.

Second, caring for the animals taught Luke to be responsible and to be a hard worker.

In the passage Luke said he had to make sure he fed the animals, give them water every day, and clean the stalls.

He also said ha had to be a night guard and check on the animals every hour to make sure everything was okay.

Next, other than taking care of the animals and doing different work, Luke also got to see new things and have fun.

He said he saw China, Europe, the Acropolis in Greece, an excavated castle in Crete,and the Panama Canal.

He also went on a gondola ride in Venice, Italy.

Even on the boat Luke had fun.

He and the other cowboys played baseball and volleyball games, had tournaments, and did other enjoyable things.

Finally, Luke saw people that were hurting and that needed his help.

Luke said '' I'm grateful for the opportunity,'' and that '' It made me more aware of people...''

Because of the Seagoing Cowboys program, Luke helped many others, even after he was discharged from the program.

The Seagoing Cowboys program was a eye opening adventure for Luke.

It can also be a life changing experience for other people too.

They can learn lessons and help people just like Luke did.

It may also change their outlook on life. They may want to do more to help others in need, rather than just helping themselves.              ","

In the passage it says ""It took about two weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern coast of the United States and a month to get to China."" To me i don't think i would be able to stay on a boat for two weeks and a month its jsut alot of sitting down, and you dont get any rest. Its alot to do when your travling for two weeks and a month.

My argument about Luke's point of view is that it would seem pretty cool to sail and go on journeys with Luke.

He seems like a person who would love people to come along with him on his jouneys and help him explore new things, and keep watch for things, animals, and maybe people. Luke just seems like a very active person who loves people to help him explore.

I think this because he's very very active and he likes to explore. He enjoys his doing what he does if he can travel for more than two weeks. If he can explore and help out . That really shows that he loves his job.         ","

F-cowboy165,"Their are three reasons why Luke's point of view convince people that they should participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program. One reason was that it was an expirience of a life time,he does what he likes to do,and he gets free time to do fun things. Thoes are the reasons why Luke's point of view convinces others to participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program.

I can support this answer that the Seagoing Cowboy's program was an expirience of a life time when the passage says ""but the Seagoing Cowboy was much more than an adventure for Luke Bomberger"".""It opended up a new world for him"". I can also support that it was an exprirence of a life time when the text says,""I'm greatful for this for this opportunity,""he says.""It makes me more aware of people in other contries and their needs.""thats the reason that it was an expirience of a life time.

I can support that he gets to do what he likes to when the texts says that ""Biside helping people ,I had a side benifitt of seeing

Europe and China. I can also support that he likes what hes doing when the text says ""Luke also tored and excavatede Crete and marvoloues at the Panamna Canal on his way to China.""

I can support that found free time to do fun thing when the text says the cow boys played baseball and volleyball table tennis and more fun things. They also boxed read whiting and more those are the reasons how he got to do fun things

In conclusion he did alot of things to inspire people to be a Seagoing Cow boy. If mre people were like hime the world would be a better place. ","

F-cowboy166,"Luke has crossed on the atlantic ocean 16 times. It took him about two weeks to get there and back. He took care of the anmials on the crossing so that kept him busy most of the time. There is good things that happend and some bad things that happen with becoming a seagoing cowboy.

First, you need to be trained if u are not trained then why would you even go in the first place. You need to stay fit, u need to be able to survie with out food incase you run out or run out of water. Helping out on his aunts farm helped him get in shape and prepared for a real adventure. On his seconed trip he was the night watchman . That does not take so much hardwork but staying up is the key. He had to check on the animals every hour, and then tell about his hourly report. But he could not work for a while because he broke one of his ribs.

Next, he did not just go to help people even know that was his main priorty. he also went to see all thease beaituful places the would have been arriving to.

Then, they would still have fun on board it is not as bad as u think. You still get to play baseball and volleyball games where all the animals had been staying will they were on board. They played thease games to pass time, table - tennis tourmants, fencing, boxing, reading, and whittling.

last, of all the cattle boat trips, were unbelievable opportiny for a small - town boy he says. Beside helping people getting to travel areound the world it was just brethtaking. Most of his trips were a susses I enjoyed the trips and can't wait for more.

To sum up my thoughts, I think he should go u still get fun out of this trip it is not like you have to work all day and night. He endeded up going and he had a great time. He said in this passage it opended up a whole new world for me. From day one crossing the atlantice ocean. I new right then and there this was a oppurtuntiy of a life time.  ","

On the boat he got to play baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where animals had been housed with the cowboys. He also got to do table-tennis tournaments, boxing, fencing, reading, whittling, and other games.

F-cowboy178,"You will like to join the Seagoing Cowboys because you will take care of the animals that are on the boat. You will get to sightsee and go to different countries that you have never been before. After the animals leave the boat you get to do things on the boat like reading, Table-tennis tournaments, boxing, and more fun activites. Everyday you maybe need to go to deliver the animals to a new country and you will get to feed them and take care of them. This boy named Luke graduatied and his life changed after he said yes to go on a cattle boat.

First, Luke graduated high school and he had two part-time jobs one at the grocery store and one at the bank his friend Don invited him on a cattle boat to go to Europe he said yes and he knew it was an opportunity of a lifetime. When it was nineteen fourty-five World War two was over in Europe and the UNRRA hired Seagoing Cowboys to take care of the animals that were shipped over sea. Luke and Don singed up to be Seagoing Cowboys and in August nineteen fourty-five they received their orders to report to New Orleans and Luke says, ""We arrived August fourteen the day the pacific war ended."" so they both got their seaman's papers and boarded the SS Charles W. Wooster, that was headed for Greece. Luke turned eightteen which meant he could be drafted for the military service. By the time he was discharged in 1947, Luke made nine trips which was the most of any Seagoing Cowboy.

If you love to travle and be on the sea then this is a perfect job for you. On the job you go to new plarts of the world.

why you shouldn't join is because you might fall overboard and noone might noice that you fell. Or the ship might fail at working and sink and you might not have a boat incase that might happen. What if the ship gets hit and you all start to sink.

Luke said being a cowboy is much more than a adverture for Luke Bombeger. Also being a cowboy opened the world to him and he is greatful for that opportunity of being a cowboy. He also said it make him more aware of people in countries and their needs.

F-cowboy181,"Luke encourages people to join the seagoing cowboys program because he thinks since when he were in the program it was amazing I know this because in paragraph 5 it says the cattle-boat trips were unbeliveible opportunity for a small town boy.

Also it says But seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special so was taking a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, a city with streets of water. I think he thinks that the places they go are really special because each one of the Countries has different things about that country. Maybe one country might be more poor than the other but he is impress how they are manaing to keep their selves together and not fall apart.

Another reason I think Luke trys to convince people to join this program is so they can learn and change the way they used to be. The program can teach them alot I know this because in paragraph 7 it says Helping out on his aunt katie's farm as a boy had prepared luke for hard work, but not for dangers at the sea. Thats teaching him how to survive on his own he's getting taught and he is changing during this program so thats what he thinks this pro gram can do for other kids wanting to do this program.

Luke trys to tell you all the things you can be instead of the things you think you have to be. Before Luke was in this program he worked at a grocery store and as a banker I know this because in paragraph 1 it says Luke Bomberger had no idea that hi life could change soon after his high school graduation. he was working part time jobs in a grocery store and a bank when his friend Don invited him to go to Europe on a cattle boat so that why I think he trys to encourage people to join the program.

On his first (1st) trip the crew he was with ended up with 335 horses on the cargo, and had enough to feed everyone including the men on the ship.

The story of Luke Bomberger is probably not urging you yet, but when Luke was official 18 he knew that he could join military. Then he thought I still love seagoing trips, so I'm going to stick with it so he did. Do you see how motivated Luke was to join the Club of UNRRA. Luke already taken a total of nine(9) trips and he was proud of it. Luke couldnt imagine his life without the trips he wouldn't have gone on so he stayed on going with it and he was confident in his choice.

Not just that but Luke got to visit other countries such as China and European countries, such as Venice, Italy. He also got to help people all over the world. He was so proud of what he did and so full of joy. Luke oncer got hurt on one (1) of his journeys. While Luke was checking on the anoimals on a very rainy night he slipped and fell but luckly there was a small piece of metal that protected Luke from flying off the deck into the Atlantic Ocean, but thanks to that small piece of metal he was saved.

So ask yourself do you want to join the UNRRA club(united Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Adminstration). If you do make sure on your descions that you want to do it. Anything is possible for anyone! If it was possible for Luke Bomberger than its possible for you! So sign up now if you want to be a success like Luke Bomberger!

F-cowboy185,"In a Cowboy who Rode the waves , the author talks about the Seagoing Cowboys program. Not only does this program help victims , but it can save many cities that would soon start a war. Luke went over the Atlantic Ocean 16 times to help WW2 victims and help their community grow and rebuild their city. There are more than 1,000 victims in each world war that happens and just imagine how many animals were killed too.

One way you could join the Seagoing Cowboys would be to simply sign up for it, since Luke claims that he just signed up ,as stated in the text. You could also join the UNRRA and get the opportunity to get to choose every branch that could help victims in need. Even though Luke signed up to help the Cattle boat, he got to go sight seeing in China, Acroppolis , Venis,Italy and the Panama Canal.

Out of all of the time, Luke was on the Cattle boat , but in the text it states that he did the same things on his Aunts farm, but did not help him at sea. One day a bad storm hit and he landed by the animal pens and landed on a pice of metal , he could not work for a few days because of his broken ribs. He was happy to be alive but when the animals were shipped the crew would play lots of fun games. He had done this 9 times to and from where they were getting dropped off at. Also, he crossed the Atlantic Ocean 16 times.

After doing this job he helped get awareness of everything and why other people needed to join . He helped most victims with getting a new home and rebuilding their city. Luke enjoyed doing this job and loved playing with the crew after the animals were loaded. For Luke this was more than a job. After all he had to have a little adventure , right?

In conclusion , Luke loved his job. It was as it was all an adventure. The text states that it opened a new world to him. After that he raised more awareness. All i know is that he will , Survive !","

F-cowboy186,"Luke Bomberger became a Seagoing Cowboy he helps people whose lives had been affected by World War ll. Luke became a Seagoing

Cowboy because he knew it was an opportunity of a lifetime, as he says in paragraph one. Luke also wanted to help others who had been affected by World War ll.

Luke crossed the Atlantic Ocean sixteen times and the Pacific Ocean twice, to help countries recover their food supplies, animals, and much more as it says in paragraph two. Even though it was a long journey across the oceans and the waters were rough Luke loved being a Seagoing Cowboy and he loved to help the people.

Some people would probably refuse to go to another country that had just been through war some people would say it was to risky and unsafe well it is, some people might say that it is too dangerous to cross the ocean well it is but Luke felt that these were things that he needed to do and is something that is important to him.

Luke also got to visit many great places in between his journeys, he got to see many different places such as the Panama Canal on his way to China in paragraph five Luke says that ""seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special"" and ""so was taking a gondola ride in Venice , Italy a city with streets of water. Luke thought that it was all so great.

But some people might say that they wouldnt go there because once again it's just too dangerous or that if they wanted to go there then they definetly not go on a boat and they would much more want to fly there. Well once again that is their opinion and Luke was happy the way that he went and was happy that he could see it and that he go to experience the jouney.

F-cowboy189,"You should really join the Seagoing Cowboys because they have lots of fun even though it might seem scary to be on a boat with horses then yes but it is actually pretty safe. Luke may have broke a few ribs and other stuff but he had fun and if you live on a farm then you would be good for it because you have to clean out stalls and feed them and put out bals of hay for them to munch on. You could be on the next boat to be a Seagoing Cowboy of Cowgirl. You may have to do night patroll but it don't matter as long as youhave fun. Maybe even bring a friend so you don't feel so lonely if you don't know anyone.

If you don't like boats then don't do it if you like boats and horses then your the one to apply and we will send you a ticket to get on the boat and be on your way. If you want to see the world or some parts of it then sign up and come join us because we go everywhere you can imagine like China, New Zealand, and Crete. These are just a few of the places that we go to so the horses can get where they need to be. We will go way across the world just to deliver horses.

Luke had no friends when he came other than the friend that asked him to go with him to be a Seagoing Cowboy. Luke made many new friends on the boat. He made 9 (nine) trips all together from that whole career that he had with that job. He had fun and learned new things about boats and horses.

He thought it was going to be a chance of a life time but he changed his mind it being completely amazing better than what he thought it would be for someone like him. His journeys were amazing and he loved it and his family was very proud of him and his friend. He said he is grateful for the opportunity. He also said it made him more aware of people of other countries and there needs. The awareness stayed with him and it lead his family to host many of international students and exchange visiters and students for many years.

F-cowboy191,"Have you ever tried becoming a seagoing cowboy? If not, I suggest that you consider joining the program. The job of a seagoing cowboy is to take care of horses, young cows, and mules which are sent overseas to people that need them. While being in the Seagoing Cowboy program, there are many positive things such as being able to experience adventures, visiting many unique places, and having the opportunity to help people in need.

A Seagoing Cowboy is able to experience many adventures. When Luke was a seagoing cowboy, he had the chance of experiencing a storm while at sea. Think about how exciting and adventurous that would be! Also Luke says that he found time to have fun on board, especially once all the animals were taken care of or unloaded. The cowbobys would then play baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds, or set up different sporting tournements. Experiencing a storm at sea and playing many fun games on board are just two examples of the many adventures that could take place as a seagoing cowboy.

If you are a seagoing cowboy, you not only have adventures but you also can see and visit many unique places that an average person wouldn't have the opportunity to see or experience. In Luke's nine years as a seagoing cowboy, he was able to see and experience some pretty interesting things in Europe and China. He specifically saw the Acropolis in Greece, and thought that that experience was very special. On top of seeing the Acropolis, he also was able to take a gondola ride in Venice, Italy. There would also be many more places to go and people to see.

The main reason for becoming a seagoing cowboy would be to help people in need. Luke specifically helped people affected by World War II. The people affected by World War II needed food, clothing, animals, and more. Luke helped with the animals. Luke states that he was very grateful for the opportunity of becoming a seagoing cowboy so he could help people in need. He says that it made him ""more aware of people of other countries and their needs.""

Becoming a seagoing cowboy is a great experience and very beneficial. Luke says, ""the cattle-boat trips were an unbelievable opportunity for a small-town boy."" ","

F-cowboy197,"Luke Bomberger crossed the Atlantic Ocean 16 times and the Pacific Ocean twice to help people affected by Word War ll. In this passage there is a lot of good things and bad things about being Seagoing Cowboy, like what fears you have to overcome,what jobs you do, and how long you have to do it and what kind of fun they have.

To begin with,you have to be very brave to become a Seagoing Cowboy.

To become a Seagoing Cowboy you can't be scared of water or being on a boat for a long time. One day when Luke was on night watchman it was very rainy.

When he was going to make his hourly report to his captin he fell on a slippery ladder and cracked his ribs.

Next, is what jobs you do to become a Seagoing Cowboy. If you are a Seagoing Cowboy you have help a lot of people and animals.

On the way across the Atlantic Ocean, Luke's boat picked up some animals. Luke was incharge of feeding them and give them water 2 to 3 times a day. Also he had to clean up after the animals.

Last, is how long you have to be on the ship and what fun you can have.

When Luke had to cross the Atlantic Ocean it took his ship 2 weeks to get across. After the animals got unloaded, the other Seagoing Cowboys got to have some fun. The cowboys played baseball and volleyball games where the animals had been housed.

Tabel-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and games also helped pass time.

To sum up my thoughts, being a Seagoing Cowboy isn't that bad.

In the passage there is a lot of good and bad things about Seagoing Cowboys in the fears you have to overcome, how long you have to do it and the fun you can have, and the jobs you have to do. In the future, I hope we can have more people become Seagoing Cowboys.      ","

F-cowboy198,"Why do you think Don Reist want Luke Bomberger to join the Seagoing Cowboys program ? Well , i think he wants him to join the Seagoing cowboys program because he probably really like it , and want his friend to join .

One reason i think Luke joined because like he say , he think it would be an opportunity of a lifetime . in the passage it states UNRRA hires seagoing cowboys to take care of horses , young cows , and mules that were shipped overseas , Luke and Don signed up . The passage also states in August 1945 , they recieved their orders to report to New Orleans . They arrived August 14 which was the day pacific war ended .

Another reason i think Luke wanted to join , because his friend was their and he wanted to be with his friend , and do what he are doing now . The passage states when Luke's draft board learned that he was on a cattle boat , they told him to just keep doing that for his service . The passage also states Luke turned 18 before arriving in greece , which meant he could be drafted in military service .

The whole thing to the paragraphs and all the supporting details is that Don wanted Luke to be like him and asked him to sign up so they could be with eachother . They wanted to have good opportunities with eachother t, they wanted to grow up and become something just from being stated in the seagoing cowboy program . Like they say in the story at 18 before arriving in Greece you could be drafted in military . That right there means they wanted to be something like a star that everyone wants to meat or be important or be famous , because lots of times it gets boring sitting around all the time . They said "" hey lets get up and go sign up for something to become something together since we are close friends . ""            ","

Another reason i think Luke wanted to join , because his friend was their and he wanted to be with his friend , and do what he are doing now . The passage states when Luke's draft board learned that he was on a cattle boat , they told him to just keep doing that for his service . The passage also states Luke turned 18 before arriving in greece , which meant he could be drafted in military service .

The whole thing to the paragraphs and all the supporting details is that Don wanted Luke to be like him and asked him to sign up so they could be with eachother . They wanted to have good opportunities with eachother t, they wanted to grow up and become something just from being stated in the seagoing cowboy program . Like they say in the story at 18 before arriving in Greece you could be drafted in military . That right there means they wanted to be something like a star that everyone wants to meat or be important or be famous , because lots of times it gets boring sitting around all the time . They said "" hey lets get up and go sign up for something to become something together since we are close friends . ""            ]""

F-cowboy199,"Luke's claim was that when his friend Don invited him to a trip to Europe on a cattle boat and Luke knew right away he had to say yes because it was a once

in a lifetime opportunity. Also that he got to travel and exploer many diffrent

places! Another one of Lukes claim was that he was greatful for the opportunity he got to have by being a seagoing cowboy.

A few reasons to join the club it that you get to go places you probobly never been before. Also that you get to travel all over the world and explore diffrent places and see many diffrent things from many diffrent paces, just like Luke!

It may have taken him two weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern coast of the United States and a month to get to china but, it may have been worth it because Luke got to see many diffrent things and explore unique stuff! Luke would normally be caring for the animals and so it kept him busy for a long time.The cowboys played baseball and volleyball games so, if you like those games you might want to join them! Being a seagoing cowboy was much more fun than an adventure, it opened the world to Luke. Luke said he was greatful for the opportunity.

"" I had the side benifit of seeing Europe and China. "" That is what Luke said because he enjoyed being a seagoing cowboy and going on all the adventures that Luke got to do! Maybe one day if you become a seagoing cowboy you will be able to adventure all the things Luke got to do. There may

be some rough time like what Luke had when he couldn't work for a few days, for an example,

when he was a watchman and it was a rainy night Luke sliped

and fell and he had a few broken ribs but he was saved by a small strip of metal

along the edge so it stopped Luke from sliding. Luke aws happy to be alive

though! Luckly for Luke he recovered in a few days. Luke was happy to be a cowboy and you might too!

So now maybe you can consider about being a saegoign cowboy.                                         ","

F-cowboy204,"Do you know what a seagoing cowboy is? Luke Bomberger was a ''seagoing cowboy'',a person who helped foreign countries of sea's after WWII. Luke was apart of the UNRRA, (the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration)to help foreign country's who have been left in ruins get back on their feet. On his way to Europe,he had to cross the large and vast Atlantic Ocean.

To pass time on there way to Europe they played games such as,Table-Tennis,fencing,and boxing. They also read and whittled to pass time. The way Luke got into the seagoing cowboy business,was his friend asked him if he wanted to join him,and he couldn't pass up this surreal oppurtunity. But, the downside was he he had to travel the rambunctious sea's. The ship Luke and Don boarded to take these cattle over to Europe is the SS Charles W. Wooster.

Reasons join this program are that you get to help others get back on their feet in times of disaster such as war,hurricane,tsunami,nuclear disaster,or other types of disasters that may happen. But their also some dangers to be aware of. During one of Luke's journey's to Europe he slid down a slippery ladder on his backside. If it weren't for a small strip of metal he would have fallen into the dark Atlantic Ocean. But,besides broken ribs he was glad he wasn't sleeping with the fishes,literally!

It's also an adventure to. During another one of his trips he got to boat around the watery ""streets"" of Venice,Italy in a gondola. Also while in Greece he visited a excavated castle. He also marveled the Panama Canal on his way to

China. But,what came most in handy is that he used to help his Aunt Katie on her farm as a boy so, Luke was prepared for the hard work.

So as a conclusion to this story, I would hope you join an organization that helps others in need, especially countries overseas. Even though this job might be hard, your making a difference in our world and there's. You could join an orginization like UNRRA,or just simply join and orginization that helps new Americans,like immigrants from foreign countries fit in in our society today in America. That would be a good example our country could set for other countries. This should be our goal for every thing and anything. Are goal should be to help others and just not ourselves. We need to stop being selfish and help other's get back on there feet if their in times of need. This is the example we should set as The United States of America.","

F-cowboy206,"Being a Seagoing Cowboy is much more than just taking care of the animals and cleaning the stalls for the animals.

Doing this, it could open up your eyes to a new world and explore new places.

Luke though it was an opportunity of a lifetime.

The cattle-boat trips were an unbelievable opportunity for a small-town boy, he says. Besides helping people, I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China. But seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special, he says. So was taking a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, a city with streets of water.

The fact that Luke thought helping all of those people in need, shows you that he wanted to help them.

But, not only was he taking care of the people and helping them, he was also helping the animals. I think he also liked taking care of the animals himself.

When people think of a Cowboy, they see someone wearing cowboy boots and riding a horse.

They also see a farm with a whole bunch of animals.

If someone is a cowboy, they normally like animals and taking care of them.

Like also liked the trips coming back. They played baseball and volleyball games in the empty stalls where animals had been. Table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and other games that also helped pass the time.

You also got to visit unique places.

Luke got to go to Greece, China, and even toured an excavated castle in Crete.

He also marveled at the Panama Canal, during his trip to China.

Since Luke didn't just go once, he must have enjoyed going on the trips and helping people.

In conclusion, being a Seagoing Cowboy can open up a new world to you. Not only does it let you visit new and unique places, you get to help animals and people that are in need of it.

It sure was like that to luke.","

Luke said, so he spreads the word to the other guys and they all think it's a great idea. Luke was amazed everyone was wanting others to join the program also. All of a sudden luke thought to himself ''We'll be getting back on board in three more days. So he told the guys that they need to get the word out to as many people as they could instantainiously. So they thought of a plan then one of the guys blurted out and said, 'since were on land right now we could probably find a radio station around here."" So the other guys gave him a high five and telling him that's an brilliant idea. So the guys took a map and started roaming around seeing if they could find a radio station. And about two hours later of searching they finally found a little radio station in the middle of no where. So Luke lead the the group of gentlemen in the little radio station and spoted an old man drinking coffe just sitting there. So as soon as Luke said 'Excuse me sir?.'' The old man jumped up instantainioulsy and said, 'AHHH! who are you and what do you want?"". So all the gentlemen introduced theirselfs and told the old man how trhey needed to let others know about their program and how they needed his help.

Three day later it was time to take off and get ready to start sailing so Lucas did a head count.

Would you like to be part of the Seagoing Cowboys program? If you don't, I am going to tell you about a text I read about a man. In this text, it says that a man named Luke Bomberger was working two part-time jobs in a grocery store and a bank when his friend Don Reist invited him to go to Europe on a cattle boat. Luke couldn't say no. He knew it was an oppurtunity of a lifetime.

It was 1945, World War II was over in Europe, and many countries were left in ruins. To help these countries recover their food supplies, animals, and more, 44 nations joined together to form UNRRA, a relief and rehabilitation administration. UNRRA hired ''Seagoing Cowboys'' to take care of the horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas. Luke and his friend Don signed up for the Seagoing Cowboys program. In the text it also says that Luke went on cattle-boat trips. He also got to go to many places across the country. He also found time to have fun on board, ecspecially on return trips after the animals had been unloaded.

The cowboys played baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where animals had been housed. But being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more than an adventure for Luke Bomberger. It opened up the world to him. ""I'm grateful for the opportunity,"" he says. ""It made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs."" That oppotunity of a lifetime is good to have because you could experience adventures you have never experienced before, and that is why you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program.

Luke also toured an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on his way to China.

It is not all just fun and games for Luke. It took about two weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern coast of the United States and a month to get to China. Caring for the animals during the crossings kept Luke busy.

They had to be fed and watered two or three times a day. Bales of hay and bags of oats had to be pulled up from the lower holds of the ship. Stalls had to be cleaned.

Helping out his aunt Katie's farm as a boy had prepared Luke for hard work, but not for the dangers at sea. On his second tripLuke served as night watchman. His job was to check on all the animals every hour. One rainy night, After making his hourly report to the captain, he slid down a slippery ladder on his backside. Luke's heart raced as he shot feet first towardan opening on the side of the ship. A small strip of metal along the edge stopped his slide, keeping him from flying overboard into the dark Atlantic. He was happyto be alive. But he couldn't work a couple of days because of cracked ribs.

But being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more than an adventure for Luke Bomberger. It opened up the world to him. ""I'm grateful the opportunity.""

""It made me more aware of people of countries and there needs."" And that awareness stayed with him, leading his family to host a number of international students and exchange vistors for many years.

F-cowboy217,"The Seagoing Cowboy Heros

Do you like going to new places around the world? Would you like to join the Seagoing Cowboys program? If you would, then go to China. The Seagoing Cowboys program is a program to take care of the horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas. Luke Bomberger crossed the Atlantic Ocean 16 times and the Pacific Ocean twice to help people affected bt World War 2.

Luke Bomberger had no idea that his life would change soon after his high school graduation. He was working two part-time jobs in a grocery store and a bank when his friend Don Reist invited him to go to Europe on a cattle boat. Luke couldn't say no. He know it was an opportunity of a lifetime. He had to go. It was 1945, World War 2 was over in Europe, and many countries were left in ruins. To help these countries recovert their food supplies, animals, and more, 44 nations joined together to form UNRRA (the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration). UNRRA hired ""Seagoing Cowboys"" to take care of the animals that were shipped overseas. Luke and Don signed up.

Here are some reasons you should join Seagoing Cowboys program. The first reason is that you could travel around the world if you like to travel. The second reson is that you would get to take care of animals, such as cow, horses, and even mules! How cool is that. The third reason is that you can play games!

The cowboys played baseeball and volleyball games in the empty holds where animals had been housed. Table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing,reading,whittling, and games also helped pass the time. But being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more than an adventure for Luke Bomberger. It opened up the worlkd to him. ""Im grateful for the opportunity,"" he says. ""It made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs."" And that awareness styaed with him, leading his family to host a number of international students and exchange visitors for many years. So, after i gave you reasons and supported my answer with details, would you want to go to Seagoing Cowboys program?? ","

So Luke and Don signed up.

In August 1945,they received an order to go to New Orleans. They arrived on the 14th of August the day the pacific war ended says Luke. They got there papers and got a boat called the SS Charles W. Wooster and headed towards Greece. They were delivering 335 horses and enough hay and oats to feed them. Be for they got to Greece Luke turned 18 years old. That ment that he could be drafed at any time to go to war. When he told them that he was on a cattle-boatr trip they told him to do it for the Military Service. Luke had made nine trips that more then any seagoing cow boy has ever made.

The cattle boat trip was an alsome trip for a small town boy Luke say. besides helping people he also got to see different countries like all of Europe and China but when he saw Acropolis in Greece it was special to him Luke says. It toke Luke and Don abount two weeks to crose the Atlantic ocean from the eastern coast that is a long time on water non stop that would make me sick and never ride a boat again but sometimes you have to do things you dont want to do.

When Luke was little he helped his aunt Katie's farm ou when he was a boy and he has worked hard ever since that is my dream is to work on a farm. It did not teach him the dangers of the sea though. When he was on his secened trip he was a night watchman. He had to check on all of the animals every hour and that was easy i bet because of him helping on a farm when he was a kid that was the same but it was on a boat. When he was reporting to the captin one time he slipoed and fell on the ground and a peice of meatal stop him from going over board.

So that was my eassy on Luke and his life I really liked this story alot i would have wrote more but i am about out of time so thats all i got.

F-cowboy219,"Their are many reasons you should join the Seagoing Cowboys programs. One of Luke's reason you should join the the Seagoing Cowboys program is having the ability to see the world. Luke did this when he was with the Seagoing Cowboys program. He traveled to Europe and China. Luke saw the Acropolis in Greece. Luke was also able to take a gondola ride in Venice, Italy.

Another one of Luke's reason you shouls join the Seagoing Cowboys program is helping the animals. The Seagoing Cowboys program was hired by the UNRRA to take good care of horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas to other countries. Luke was able to feed the horses with hay and oats. Luke had to water and feed the animals two to three times a day. He also had to clean the animals stall. Luke had to haul bales of hay and bags of oats from the lower holds of the ships. Luke also had the job of checking up on the animals at night every hour.

Another one of Luke's reasons you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program is how much fun you can have. On the return trips when the animals have been unloaded. Luke and his fellow cowboys played baseball and volleyball games in the empty stalls where the animals had been housed. Luke and his cowboy friends played table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading and other games also helped the cowboys to have fun and pass the time.

Those were three of Luke's reason of why you should join the Seagoing Cowboys programs. Lets review what those three reasons are the first one is being able to see the world, the second one is being able to help and care for the animals, and the last reason is being able to have fun.","

F-cowboy221,"In the story, ""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves,"" Luke is a boy from a small town and is a cowboy that is almost 18 years old. His friend convenced him to go and help the peolpe across seas that are injured from World War ll. He decided to go and help. When he was on his first trip to go to help he turned 18 and was supposte to go into the army but they said to keep helping, and that would be his serivce time.

Luke has a good idea to help spread the word. He should try to convince people to go and help people that got hurt in World War ll. He should start by telling a lot of people about the Seagoing Cowboys program. lso, he should tell people what they do. Next, he should make posters to show people that the Seagoing Cowboys extict. Then, he should say where they going and how they are seeing all of the different historial places along the way. Finally, he should tell the people what the program offers and how they visit many unique places.

Some reasons to join the Seagoing Cowboy programs are, that you get to take care of animals when you are going across the ocean. Also, you get to help people that need to things that you are bring to them. A lot of things were lost in World War ll. So, you can help give back from the people that we took stuff away from. Also, you see a lot of different cultures. You would get to see the way that people live. Then, when you are over there you can see what the country's culture is. Like, when you are in China you can see all of the stuff that they make over there. You might even see some of the places that were attacked. When you go different place, you get to see different things that you may of never seen before. When you are over seas you can see many interseting things. That is one reason that you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program.

Another reason that you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program is that once you drop off all of the animals and help the people you have one or two months with open animal cages. On the way back you can play games like, you can wrestle, have table-tennis tournaments, you can fence, and you can box. There are many other game that you could play. So there is another reason that you should join the

Seagoing Cowboys program.

The first reason is the program helps with people in need. Luke and Don go help people and sign up for program. Example-

Luke helped Katie's farm for checking the animals every night. Then he slipped and cracked his ribs so he coudn't work for a couple days. He also took care of cattle while on board.

The second reason is Luke going around the world. He went to many parts of Europe. In Greece he got drafted with the military. He went to China to help animals with crossings. In the Pacific and atlantic ocean he took care of animals, while going to Europe. There were alot things to do.

The last reason is Luke going around and giving supplies. In the first paragraph he worked a two- part job. Then when going to Europe he gave cattle to people or farmers. He probably gave them food and water. The reason is because is the end of WWII and buildings are down.

The Seagoing Cowboys program is a program for helping others. To sum marize the reasons. The program helps with people in need, the program goes around the world, and the program helps with livestock and supplies. Luke did a great thing to help with the world. ","

F-cowboy224,"Being a Seagoing Cowboy was a fun and unique job. Like Luke you got to help many people and visit many places. Such as when Luke mentions that he took a gondola ride in Vinice, Italy, a city with streets of water or when he saw the Acropolis in Greece. You also get to help many people. Luke being a Seagoing Cowboy meant that he supplied poor areas in Europe with cattle to recover their food supplies, animals, and more.

The reason why I say it is fun to be a Seagoing cowboy is, because as Luke mentions when all of the cattle was unloaded they often played table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling and baseball and volleyball games. Luke also mentions that being a Seagoing Cowboy was an oppurtunity of a lifetime that he would not want to miss. Luke aslo mentions that caring for the animals on these long voyages often kept him busy along with other things he had to do such as, feeding the animals, watering the animals two to three times a day, bales of hay and bags of oats had to be pulled from the lower holds of the ship.

Being a Seagoing Cowboy is an interesting job. Your never bored, your always seeing places, and your always having fun. Whats not to like about it? For Luke being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more the adventure, but it opened up the world to him. He also so said that it made him more aware of people of other countries and their needs.

F-cowboy226,"There could be reasons of how you can join the program. There is a lot of reasons. Luke had no idea that his life would change soon after his high school graduation. He was working two part-time jobs in a grocery store and a bank. Luke signed up to join the program, which is, UNRRA (the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administrations). The program hired ""Seagoing Cowboys.""

The program hired ""Seagoing Cowboys"" because they can take care of the horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas. So Luke and his friend signed up and they went to New Orleans. They found horses there. They keep on going to places, that was like an adventure to them. They keep on going and they were arriving to Greece for their second mission.

Luke turned 18 before arriving to Greece. By the time he was discharged in 1947, Luke had made nine trips-the most of any Seagoing Cowboy. Luke said, ""Besides helping people, I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China. But seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special."" Luke was also taking a ride in Venice, Italy, a city with streets of water too. He was looking at a lot of things in Greece. His next stop was at China.

It took about two weeks to cross the Atlanta Ocean from the eastern coast of the United States and a month to get to China. Luke was so busy taking care of the animals. He took so many adventures. Being a Cowboy was much more than an adventure for Luke. It opened up the world to him.

There was a lot of adventures going on. It took him years to go around the world and explore. He was great of being a Seagoing Cowboy. He even loved to going to this mini adventures. It was a great experinced.           ","

So if I were you I would take as many chances as I could.

For one Bomberger had a blast traveling to many different places, it says in paragraph 5 he toured an excavated castle in Crete and marveled the panama canal on his way to China .Crazy amazing, right? He was admiring one place on his way to another. What a lucky guy.

Another thing is Bomberger Got to go places that many people may never go. For example He had been to China, Eastern coast of the US, and Europe. Way farther out of North America then Ill ever be. He was probably millions of miles away from where his comfort zone (his house).

Also just the over-all experience you get when you do or try something new. Bomberger states in paragraph 9 that being a seagoing cowboy was much more fun of an adventure. Its all about the people you share the moment with also, they could make it adventerious, scary, fun, or sad.

But do you see getting pushed of of a 1,000,000,000,000 building (your comfort zone) can be fun, scary, or of course uncomfortable. So next time you want to say no to some thing, take chances and say YES. ","

F-cowboy230,"Why should you become a Seagoing Cowboy? Well first let me tell you about a boy named Luke who was a Seagoing Cowboy. A Seagoing Cowboy is on this boat with other Seagoing Cowboys. To go help Europe where World War II just ended.

They were heading over to Europe because, many countries over there were ruined. So they were coming over to bring them food supplies, animals, and more. If you love to help, this would be something for you that you would enjoy. Luke traveled through the Atlantic occean and pacific. Trying to help these countries that were left in ruins. When Luke was on the boat he had a job to do. He had to feed the animals and keep them healthy. He also had to clean the animals and keep there stalls clean.

When your a Seagoing Cowboy you have a big responsibility. You also have alot of jobs to take care of. Another job Luke had, was a night watchman. That job was to check on all the animals every hour. Then make his hourly report to the captain. A Seagoing Cowboy wasn't always working. When they unloaded the animals and were heading back there was an empty space. So sometimes the cowboys played games. Like baseball, volleyball, table-tennis, fincing, boxing, and more. Luke always enjoyed that part.

So this is what a Seagoing Cowboy is and what he does. If your someone who's willing to be on a boat for a long time and take care of animals and if you also love to help people. This job is perfect for you. While your on the boat you get to make new friends and explore unique places. It was just a big adevnture. Also if you love dealing with animals this is another good reason to become a Seagoing Cowboy. Take the information that I gave you. Luke loved being a Seagoing Cowboy and if you have the heart like Luke, this is the job for you. ","

""Luke found time to have fun on board he played table tennis, fencing, boxing, reading, and even whittling. If that's not enough I don't know what is. Being a Seagoing Cowboy is just an opportunity you don't want to miss. ]""

So in August of 1945 Luke and Don went to New Orleans to take apart in helping families. After getting their papers from the seaman they went and borded the SS Charles W. Wooster, they headed for Greece with a cargo of 355 plus horses and enough hay and oats to feed them. Luke ended up turning 18 before arriving at Greece. Luke realized that he could be drafted for military service but everyone just told him to what he's doing now as his military service. On his second trip he served as night watchman after doing his hourly report to the captian it was a rainy night and the ladders were slick and Luke slipped down the ladder on his backside and almost feel feet first out of the ship into the dark Dark Atlantic Ocean. But a small piece of metal caught and saved him. He was happy to be alive. But he couldn't do anything for a couple days because of some cracked ribs. Luke said it's more fun on the way back because when they drop off the animals the stalls are empty and they can play games like baseball, table tennis, and volleyball.

F-cowboy236,"Luke Bomberger had got asked to join this program called '' Seagoing Cowboys.""

He was working at two part time jobs, one of the jobs were grocery store and the other one was the bank. Then, Lukes friend Don Reist invited Luke to go to the cattle boat in Europe. Luke couldnt say no because that has always been Lukes dream. Then he thought, that would be the opportunity of his lifetime to work on the cattle boat!

The reason Luke wanted to work onthe cattle boat was because the World War II just got done in Europe. He also wanted to help Europe get there food supplies, animals, and familys back together. Fourty-Four nations joined in on this program. The name of the program was called ""Seagoing Cows"" because they took care of the horses, young calfs, mules that were on there way over seas. Europe needed despirate help when this incident happened.

Acording to the story, on August 1945, they arrived on August 14th. On that day the Pacific War ended. They had a cargo with 335 horses plus hay and oats to feed them. Luke turned 18 when he was onthe cattle boat headed towrds Greece, and that meant he could be drafted to the military services! By the time he was discharged in 1947, Luke Bomberger had made nine trips, then he got told that he had the most Seagoing Cowboys trips in the program!

Luke always said ""the cattle-boat trips were so unbelievable opportunity for a small town boy!"" Besides helping people Luke had the benefit of seeing Europe and China. Seeing the Acropolis was very special, Luke said. He enjoyed being a Seagoing Cowboy.

Being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more than an adventure for Luke Bomberger. It opened up his world to help people and be kind and helpful to people who need help. A good reason for joining the Seagoing Cowboys program is because you can relize how you have good towns and good houses and some countries don't have that. It shows how you canbe helpful and you need to be greatful for what you have and dont have!","

F-cowboy240,"This story is about Luke Bomberger a boy who rode the waves had no idea that his life would change soon after his graduation. He was working two part-time jobs in a grocery store and at a bank when his friend invited him to go to Europe on a cattle boat. He couldn't say no he knew it would be an opportunity for him. It was 1945,world war 2 was over in Europe and countries were left in ruins. To help these countries recover 44 nations came together and started UNRRA {The United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration}. UNRRA hired seagoimg cowboys to take care of the horses,young cows, and the mules.

The first reason to join the program is because they came together and started a group of 44 nations to help Europe. They hired ''Seagoing Cowboys'' to help the animals. They are trying to get the nation back together. Luke and Don signed up for it to. Heading over seas in August 1945, they recieved their orders to report to New Orleans. They arrived ''August 14,'' Luke sayed,the day the Pacific war ended.''

The second reason you should join the group is because '' The cattle-boat trips were an unbelievable opportunity for a small-town boy,'' he said.''Besides helping people, had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China. But seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special,'' he says. ''So was taking a Gondola ride in Venice,Italy,a city with streets of water.'' Luke also toured an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on his way to china.

The third reason why you should join the group is cause caring for the animals during the crossings kept luke busy. They had to be fed and watered two or three times a day. Bales of hayand bags of oats had to be pulled up from the lower holds of the ship. Stalls had to be cleaned. Helping out on his aunt Katie's farm as a boy had prepared luke for hard work.

In conclusion I think you can still help with or without an reward. He did that from heart to help and sign up for that, also he liked watching the animals every hour and taking care of them so did his friend. He really liked the trips around the world too, just help to be nice somtimes for other people.","

This story is mainly about how great Seagoing Cowboys are and what they bring to other countries. They transported animals to other countries who didn't have food or transportation. Seagoing Cowboys were true heroes, they cared for animals and people. They had kind hearts for both of them.      ","

F-cowboy250,"""A cowboy who rode the waves"" is a story where there is so much going on with so many people.

The main character in the story is ""Luke Bomberger"" he works two part-time jobs one at the Grocery Store and the other at the Bank. He has a friend named Don

Reist whom asked Luke to go to Europe with him. They would be riding on a cattle boat with 335 horses only. The reason they had to ride on a cattle boat was because World War 2 just ended and most people animals and buildings got destroyed. They were shipping animals over to Europe so that they could have their animals back. He just turned 18 before they left so he was old enough to help out. Since they had all of the horses he helped out with taking care of them they each had to be fed and watered two or three times a day. He was really good at taking care of all the horses because he used to help out on his aunt's farm with all of the animals. He had trouble sometimes when the storms would be super bad and it would make the boat rock with the bad waves. One time he was going to report back to the captin with the news on how the animals were doing because he was on nightwatch and he slipped and fell off of his ladder. When the boat started tilting he went slididng down the deck of the boat and amost went off board. He didn't go off board luckily because a metal bar stopped him from going two far but he did suffer from broken ribs and have to take some time off. On the trips back to go get more animals the people he was with would play games with him and they also got to see amazing sights on their way there and back sometimes even on the way there is they weren't too busy.

Most of the time this is what happens but his story is really interesting. Most people think it is a horrible idea to do this but I think it's a great one because you get to help people. It is nice to do something like that because most people are less fortunet and things that happened in Europe can happen to them and maybe even you when you don't ever expect it.","

F-cowboy255,"Others should not participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program. It is a very dangerous and risky thing to do. The waves can also make people scared because they don't want the ship to flood and sink.

The Seagoing Cowboys program is not good for your body. It can get you seriously injured like when Luke Bomberger slide down a slippery latter on his backside and cracked his ribs. Luke Bomberger almost died by flying over the edge of the ship, but a small strip of metal alonge the edge stopped his slide. That is a way you can die participating in the Seagoing Cowboys program.

F-cowboy257,"I think other people should participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program because you could explore alot of things.

The reason I think people should participate in this program is because you get to go on vacations and you almost get to explore around the world. You also are crossing the Atlantic Ocean and also going to China. It also seems like a fun activity because in paragraph nine it says that Luke was grateful for the opportunity. In paragraph five it also says that he toured and excavated castle's while he was on his way to China. You had to do a little work to because its says in paragraph seven during the crossings it kept Luke busy and he had to check the animals every hour. I also believe it is alot of traveling because in the introduction it says that Luke crossed the Atlantic Ocean more than 16 times. In paragraph nine it also talks about how he felt much more than just an adventure for Luke. In paragraph four its says that they knew he was a cattle-boat trip but they told him just to keep doing it for his service.

There is also many other different things to do if you want to become a Seagoing Cowboy and I think Luke really enjoyed it because in paragraph seven it says that Luke was happy to be alive. Also on Luke's second trip he served as a night watchman but he couldn't work for a couple of days because he cracked his ribs.

That is why I think people should patrticipate in the program because it sounds fun and enjoyable and you could also join with your friends. ","

F-cowboy261,"Can you imagine taking many oversea trips taking care of animals?! That is just what the participants in the amazing program of Seagoing Cowboys do. Three reasons for joining the Seagoing Cowboys are that the Seagoing Cowboys help people affected by wars, the Seagoing Cowboys get to see many amazing places, and the Seagoing Cowboys have much fun on their journeys.

Most importantly, the Seagoing Cowboys save lives. The ""Cowboys"" take trips with many animals, and all of the supplies to take care of these animals. When the animals arrive at their destination, they are given away to hungry families. The text reads, ""UNRRA hired ""Seagoing Cowboys""to take care of the horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas.""

Equally important,Seagoing Cowboys got to see amazing places on their journeys. The Cowboys travel all over the world and went sightseeing evrywhere they went. When they went to Greece, they saw the Parthenon and a excavated castle in Crete. They got to see many differnt sight in China. The text states, ""' So was taking a Gondola ride in Venice, Italy, a city with streets of water.'""

Lastly, the Seagoing Cowboys had a ton of fun on their boat rides, despite the fact that they had to take care of animals. They played volley ball in emty stalls.

On his second trip Luke had to served his night as a watchman. His job was to check on the animal every hour. On this one rainy night after making his hourly report to the captain he slid down a slippery ladder on his backside.

You get to go to different places like Greece, and by time he got to Greece he was 18 years old that meant that he could draft for military service. Then he could see Europe and China. They crossed the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern coast of the United States and a month to get to China. Caring for the animals during the crossing kept luke busy. They had to feed and water them two to three times a day. The stalls had to be cleaned.

Luke was already for this because he worked on a farm with aunt Katie's farm as a boy had perpared Luke for hard work but not the dangers at the sea. He had different jobs each time. The second time he was a watchman. And his job was to check the animals every hour.

But being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more than an adventure for Luke. It had opened the world to him. But he was greatful for the opportunity. It made him more aware of of people of other countries and their needs. And the awareness stayed with him, leading his family to host a number of international students and exchange visitors for many years.

That is why Luke's point of view for people to participate in the Seagoing Cow boys. And I think that it would be good for people to do what he did that way you get to go to different places that you may of not been to before. And that way you get to see what it's like on the sea taking care of all the animals and all of the jobs that you have to do.

It would be cool if people would do what Luke did that way you get a learning time where you get to see what it was like for Luke and do what he did I think that it would be cool I we did that. And If we did what he did I think that it would be fun takeing care of the animals and on a sea ride and going to different places that are in different countries to see what there life is like and how they eat and things like that would be cool.","

F-cowboy267,"Would one like to be a Seagoing Cowboy? Well it's a bad idea to be a Seagoing Cowboy. Well first, one has to be on sea for a couple weeks. Then one also has to responsibe for taking care of animals. And lastly, one needs to be careful on a cattle boat. Being a Seagoing Cowboy is a bad, dangerous, and horrible idea.

First, a Seagoing Cowboy has to travel all around the world. Does one really wants to be sea sick? Well a Seagoing Cowboy needs to be on a cattle boat for maybe about two weeks or maybe more across the ocean. And one needs to worry about the dangers of the sea. Lastly, one needs to take night shifts for a couple reasons. What about the rest they need of being so busy? In conclusion, being a Seagoing Cowboy is about dealing with the sea. So, not only the sea is a bad idea for a job, but also taking care of the animals.

A Seagoing Cowboy is not only traveling, but also taking care of the animals. First, a Seagoing Cowboy has to take night shifts just for taking care of the creatures. One needs to check on all the animals every hour as well. Furthermore, one needs to feed them every two or three times a day. Who's going to clean the ship after the animals eat? Next, one needs to give them water as well as a plants, animals, and Seagoing Cowboys needs water. So, does one really want to be dealing with the animals and the care they need? Not only being a Sea Cowboy is a terrible idea, but also taking care of themselves and the boat.

Sometimes a Sea Cowboy can be tough, but they also need to be careful of what they're doing. Did one hear of how Luke hurt himself? Well he had a report from his captain and slid down a slippery ladder. Why was it so slippery? Well he was on a boat with water surrounding it! And if one slipped and can't swim, and went in the water...well that one person will be at the bottom of the dark Atlantic sea. But Luke cracked his ribs just from sliding down on a slippery lader on his backside. One also needs be careful of whats ahead of them. The dangers of the sea, the water, and other people who are going to want to stop a Seagoing Cowboy from saving a country. So why be a Seagoing Cowboy?

In conclusion, a Seagoing Cowboy will need to take care of themselves of being injured or sea sick, animals, and what a Seagoing Cowboy will have ahead of them. So DON'T be a Seagoing Cowboy who might be at a great risk. Next, don't be at th bottom of the sea. Another, reason for being a Seagoing Cowboy is because one doesn't want to be frustrated of taking care of couple of animals. And please don't be on a cattle boat if one doesn't want to clean what animals/peoples left overs. These are the reasons why being a Seagoing Cowboy is a terrible, horrible, bad idea.        ","

And if one slipped and can't swim, and went in the water...well that one person will be at the bottom of the dark Atlantic sea. But Luke cracked his ribs just from sliding down on a slippery lader on his backside. One also needs be careful of whats ahead of them. The dangers of the sea, the water, and other people who are going to want to stop a Seagoing Cowboy from saving a country. So why be a Seagoing Cowboy?

In conclusion, a Seagoing Cowboy will need to take care of themselves of being injured or sea sick, animals, and what a Seagoing Cowboy will have ahead of them. So DON'T be a Seagoing Cowboy who might be at a great risk. Next, don't be at th bottom of the sea. Another, reason for being a Seagoing Cowboy is because one doesn't want to be frustrated of taking care of couple of animals. And please don't be on a cattle boat if one doesn't want to clean what animals/peoples left overs. These are the reasons why being a Seagoing Cowboy is a terrible, horrible, bad idea.        ]""

F-cowboy277,"If you wanna travel tons of times and help others you should join the Seagowing Cowboys they help others by providing people food, animals, and more. In the passage it said that fourty-four nations combine to form the UNRRA, also known as the United Nations Relief and Rehabailitation Administration. You should definately join because you are helping others even thogh it might be fun to travel its also a great feeling when you help others. Those are some reasons you should join the Seagoing Cowboys.

According to the article Don and Luke signed up to take care of the horses, young cows, and mulesthat were shipped overseas. Luke traveled many times traveling more than any other Seagoing Cowboy at 9 times. He liked traveling but he really like supporting others. For example when Europe was left in ruins as wll as many other countries the Seagoing Cowboys would help them which I can imagine was a tremendes feeling. People will appreciate you more for helping others. Thats another reason you should be a Seagoing Cowboy.

In the story it said that the Seagoing Cowboys went to Greece witha cargo of 335 horses and enough hay and oats to feed them so that they would be healthy which also means that they help the animals too. It also said in the article that being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more than a adventure for Luke Bomberger, it opened up the world to him, he even said ""I'm grateful for the opportunity. This is especially a good reason because he even said that it was great which means from his prospective he appreciated the oppotunity.

Luke was thankful to help others maybe you will be too.

These are some reasons you should join the Seagoing Cowboys you will find it fun and helpful to help others. Maybe you'll find it in your heart that you will help others.   ","

F-cowboy278,"Do you like going on fun adventures, saving lifes and vistiting many unique places? Well if you join or participate the Seagoing Cowboys program you will get to go to so many places like different countries,and castles. Not only that, But save lives in different countries. You will miss out on so many fun adventures and other peoples lifes and countries if you don't join the program.

If you join the program then you will have so much fun with all the different places and adventures. One of the people who come here, named Luke has been to so many beautiful places. Luke has made nine trips, more than any member in the Seagoing Cowboys. Luke has toured an excavated castle in Crete and went to the Panama canal on his way to China.

If it wasn't for Luke's friend, Don Reist,he would have never been a member and he would have never seen any of these places that he has been to. Luke knew it was an oppurtunity of a lifetime. At the time Luke joined, World war 2 was over in Europe. Many countries were ruined and needed help, so Don and Luke joined to go on a mission to go to other countries that were ruined to help the countries recover their food supplies,animals,and more.

""The cattle-boat trips were an unbelievable opportunity for a small-town boy,"" he says. Luke has gotten hurt for other people, because he knew that what was going on in their lifes,are far worse than his. He has traveled alot and seen alot that has happend in other countries, and they need more people to save them.

Being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more than an adventure for Luke Bomberger. ""I'm grateful for the opportunity,"" he says. ""It made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs."" That awareness stayed with him throughout his life. He lead his family and international students and exchanged visitors for many years. You can join this program and save lifes of other people in different countries,and visit countries and places just like Luke Bomberger and Don Reist.                   ","

F-cowboy279,"Luke would tell people to join the Seagoing Cowboys program because it is an opportunity of a lifetime. Many people wish to do this, but they may never be able to be a part of this program, so that is why he would tell you to participate in this program.

Another reason Luke would try to convince you to join is because you could be helping people and countries by taking care of animals, such as horses, young cows, and mules.

Luke would also tell people to join the Seagoing Cowboys because you could visit new places you have never been to before, like Europe or China, or Greece and Italy. Luke had the chance of visiting these four places because he was part of the Seagoing Cowboys, and you get to cross oceans, like the Atlantic and Pacific.

Another reason luke would tell you to join the program would be because you would always be busy. The animals all needed food and water two or three times a day. Bales of hay and bags of oats ave to be pulled up from the lower level. And their stalls have to be cleaned.

Luke would also tell you to be careful if you joined the Seagoing Cowboys. On Luke's second trip, he almost fell into the dark waters of the Atlantic. He served as a watchman, and he would have to check on the animals every hour. And one rainy night, when he was going to report to the captain, he slid down a slippery ladder on his backside. His heart raced as he shot feet first toward an opening on the side of the ship. But luckily, a small strip of metal along the edge stopped him from sliding towrad the the dark Atlantic, and kept him aboard the ship. Luke was happ he was alive, but he had to take a couple of days off of work because he cracked his ribs.

But you can also have fun on the ship, especially on return trips after the animals had been unloaded. They would play baseball or volleyball games in the empty holds where the animals had been. Table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and games also helped time go by faster.

Being part of a Seagoing Cowboy can be a great expierience, and it was for Luke Bombergur. It opened the world to him. He said he was grateful for the opportunity of being part of the program. It made him more aware of people of other countries and their needs. And that awareness stayed with him, leading his family to host a number of international students and exchange visitors for many years.

That's why you should be part of the Seagoing Cowboys. It will give you great memories that will stay with you. It will give you life expierience that you might need later on in your life. It will give chances to visit new places you might love and never forget about. It will give you a chance of helping people and countries around the world. It will give you a chance to meet new people and to get to know them well. It will give you all of this and much, much more. That is why you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program. Once you decline it, you will regret you did. Once you accept it, you will be happy you entered this program.","

F-cowboy281,"In the story ""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves"" it gives information about a certain group called the Seagoing Cowboys program. One reason to join the Seagoing Cowboys program is you get to take care of animals for your service to your country in stead of having to be in the military. According to the fourth paragraph when Luke turned eighteen before getting to Greece, he would've had to automatically draft into the military. But, when the draft board learned that he was on a cattle-boat trip, they told him to just stay their for his service. Point being if you serve by being a Seagoing Cowboy you wouldn't have to be in the military enless you choose to be in it.

There are many reason's provided in the story to be a Seagoing Cowboy but one that also seems to stick out above some of the others is the sight's you see. According to paragraph five it says ""The cattle-boat trips were an unbelievable opportunity for a small-town boy,"" he says. ""Besides helping people, I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China. But seeing the Acropolis in Greece wasspecial,"" he says.""So was taking a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, a city with streets of water."" Luke also toured an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on his way to China."" Which means that if you're a Seagoing Cowboy you get to see a bunch of unique places that most people don't get to see everyday.

For my last reason that I found stated in the text to be a Seagoing Cowboy is it opens up a new world for you. As stated in the text paragraph nine ""But being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more than an adventure for Luke Bomberger. It opened up the world to him."" which shows that it teaches you and what caring for others does for you and last it shows sights you don't get to see 24/7. To conclude the paragraph being a Seagoing Cowboy is much more than seeing things you haven't seen before outside of pictures and going on adventures it's a great learning experience.

If you join the Seagoing Cowboys program you will get the great delight of caring for others, adventure, sight-seeing, and a great learning experience. All the information above is my reason's or benefits of being a Seagoing Cowboy. Think about the reason's to see if being a Seagoing cowboy is what you want to be.

F-cowboy282,"In the article ""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves"" , Luke joined , or signed up , for the Seagoing Cowboys. This job was to do hard work overseas to help with cattle and feed.

On their way, Luke went and seen different places,like China! Convincing others to participate in this important job would be hard. I think it would be hard because it is hard work. You also have to go overseas , away from your family and friends.

It would be hard to convince people to participate, or help. This is because, it is hard work, and your always busy. Here is an example from the article,""His job was to check on all the animals every hour."" That proves that he is always busy. ""But he couldn't work for a couple of days because of cracked ribs."" That is an example that he is hard working.

They have to go overseas to Greece to work as a Seagoing Cowboy. Here is an example from the text, ""They got their seaman's papers and boarded the SS Charles W. Wooster, headed for Greece.""

Your student, Emily, submitted the following essay and she is talking about the dream of becoming a cowboy:

""[Essay Content: In the article ""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves"" , Luke joined , or signed up , for the Seagoing Cowboys. This job was to do hard work overseas to help with cattle and feed.

On their way, Luke went and seen different places,like China! Convincing others to participate in this important job would be hard. I think it would be hard because it is hard work. You also have to go overseas , away from your family and friends.

It would be hard to convince people to participate, or help. This is because, it is hard work, and your always busy. Here is an example from the article,""His job was to check on all the animals every hour."" That proves that he is always busy. ""But he couldn't work for a couple of days because of cracked ribs."" That is an example that he is hard working.

They have to go overseas to Greece to work as a Seagoing Cowboy. Here is an example from the text, ""They got their seaman's papers and boarded the SS Charles W. Wooster, headed for Greece."" People would miss their friends and family. They would also be sore from all the hard work they have to do.

F-cowboy283,"In this story, Luke Bomberger was a Seagoing Cowboy who helped people during World War ll. Other people should participate in being a Seagoing Cowboy for a couple of reasons. Read this article on why more people should sign up for Seagoing Cowboys.

First of all, many countries in Europe were left in ruins and needed help. The countries are in need of their food supplies, animals, and more. With the help of more men, those needed supplies could be delievered with ease.

Along with all the hard work, there is also some fun on board, especially on return trips after the animals had been unloaded. The cowboys play baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where the animals had been housed. Table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and games are also other activities that they enjoyed.

Even with everything the Seagoing Cowboys do, they are grateful for the opportunity. Besides helping people, the cowboys had the side benefit of seeing some beautiful countries. It also made the cowboys aware of people in other countries and their needs.

In conclusion, that is why more people should sign up for the Seagoing Cowboys program. There are people in need, there is some fun on the board, and then there's the side benefit of seeing countries in or near Europe. Someday, maybe even you will be interested in joining the Seagoing Cowboys.","

In the passage ''A Cowboy Who Rode The Waves''this boy named Luke bomberger, who just graduated high school had two jobs and he got offered by his friend Don Reist to join this exiting event. Luke could not say no.

In the passage Luke said that he enjoyed the job A lot. There was many things he got to do like go over seas,he rescued animals,and more. It states in paragraph 3 that he traveled with 335 horses on August,14,1945. In my opinion that is a lot of horses on one boat.

He got to travel many places like Europe,China,Greece and more. He said that it takes about two weeks to get to cross the Atlantic ocean and a month to get to China. left time to play baseball,vollyball,tabletennis,fencing,boxing reading,and more. it says in the intro in the passage that he traveled 16 times over the Atlantic Ocean and twice over the Pacific Ocean.

As you can see it would be A lot of fun to be A seagoing cowboy. You would get to adventure things just like Luke did. In my opinion that would be A lot of fun to travel over seas and save people and animals. Not only that you will also be able to explore many things like China and Europe. and you might even see very historic things. I hope you think about this job.

F-cowboy291,"The reason we want you to be in our program is that..Luke Bomberger had no idea that his life would change vey soon, when Don Reist (Luke's friend) said that he was invited to go with him in Europe in a cattle boat. Luke couldn't say no so, he went with him for an opportunity of a life time.

In 1945, World War ll was over in Europe and many countries were left in ruins. 44 nation joined together to form a UNRRA ( the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitatiion Administration ). After that the UNRRA hired the ""Seagoing Cowboys"" to take care of the young farm animals that were shipped overseas. When luke turned 18 years old right before he arriving in Greece, which meant he could be drafted for military service. In 1947, Luke made nine trips-the most of any Seagoing Cowboy was ever been through.

The cattle-boat trips were unbelievable opportunity for a smal- town boy, Luke also toured an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on his way to China. It took about two weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern coast of the United States and a month to get to China. Bales of hay and bags of oats had to be pulled up from the lower holds of the ship. Stalls had to be cleaned. Luke also found time to have fun on board, esspecially on return trips after the animals had been unloaded. The cowboys played music, played games, sports they played, and also read to have some relaxation.

But being a Seagoing Cowboy for Luke was much more an adventure for him it also gaved him much more experience to the world than he imagined. It made Luke more aware of peole of other countries their needs. and that awareness stayed ith him, leading his family to host a number of international student and exchanged visitors for many years.

In the passage it says it was 1945, World War II was over in Europe and many countrys were left in ruins. Europe was in trouble because they needed to recover their food supplies, animals, and more. So if anything like this happened you could help them out.

The passage also says In August 1945, they received their orders to report to New Orleans. Not only you would work in Europe you would be around the world and that could be a unique adventure which you could do if u joined Seagoing Cowboys.

Lastly the passage says Luke turned 18 before arriving in Greece, which meant he could be drafted for military service. Just for signing up for the Seagoing Cowboys program it could take you to higher places.

In conclusion joining the Seagoing Cowboys program would be really intresting. You might just go to a place you always wanted to go but your not just going there because you want to go your going their for a good cause.","

F-cowboy293,"This is why you should join the seagoing cowboys,you get to travel over seas like the atlantic ocean, its also a great way to travel to new contries and see how they live and see there needs to,its also a great way to get out a see the world you get to see cool stuff and experince cool stuff to it said in the story that by the time luck was 18 he had traveld more then anyother seagoing cowboy thats really cool.

Hes still young and hes traveld alot being a seagoing cowboy is awsome and if you try it you will probably love it beacuse for luck being a sea cowboy was much more than an adventure it opened up a whole new world for him he said im grateful for the oppertunitys i have had it made me more awar of the contries and people all around me and those peoples awarness stayed with him leading his family to host a number of international students and exchange visitors for many years.

If you become a seagoing cowboy can sometimes lead to bad things like when luck slide on the ship and almost fell of the boat but then was caught by a rope that caught his fall so he was happy to still be alive and happy that he didnt go in to the atlantic ocean and when your on board its sometimes really fun especially on return trips when the animals got unloaded the cowboys play baseball and volley ball games in the empty place that the animals ounce were tabel tenniss,fencing,boxing,reading,whittling and games helped pass the time when the animals were gone.

F-cowboy295,"The Seagoing Cowboys program started after World War Two ended in Europe. The program gives young cows, horses, and mules to the countries that got destroyed in the war. They put the young cows, horses, and mules on ships then sent them to different countries.

I had two different part-time jobs and when my friend told me about this opportunity to join the Seagoing Cowboys I thought it was a once in a lifetime opportunity.

I joined the Seagoing Cowboys on the day that the war in the Pacific ended.

My very first trip was to Greece. The ships had cows and horses on them. The Sea Cowboys had to feed them twice a day, clean out their stalls, and give them fresh water to drink. There was another job to be done on ths ship there was the night watchman. The night watchmen had to check in on the animals every hour then report it to the captain. This job can be very dangerous at times because one rainy night I went to tell the captain and slid down the ladder and almost went overboard into the dark, churning ocean. A small piece of metal saved my life. I was okay but I did have two broken ribs.

I Luke did the most trips of any Seagoing Cowboy. I did sixteen across the Atlantic Ocean and two across the Pacific Ocean. I would want people to join the Seagoing Cowboys because when you are at the country that you are helping you get to visit many tourist attractions. When I was in Greece I got to see the Acropolis. The Acropolis is an ancient structure built in ancient times. I got to ride in a gondola in Venice, Italy. I toured an excavated castle in Crete. I also marveled at the Panama Canal on his way back from China.

On return trips after the animals were dropped off the men had fun. They had baseball and volleyball games in empty stalls, they also had table tennis tournements, along with boxing tournements. I also found time to have fun reading, whittling, and other fun games to pass the time at sea.

The Seagoing Cowboys would be a great way to help out others in need. I had a very amazing experience as a Seagoing Cowboy. I would want other young boys to have the same experience as I did when I joined the seagoing cowboys.

Luke says in the article, "" I'm grateful for the opportunity. It made me more aware of other people and countries' needs. Luke kept helping other people in need even after his adventure as a Seagoing Cowboy by leading his family to home a couple of international students and exchange families for many years. Luke had a great experience as a Seagoing Cowboy and he would want you to have the same experience as he did. Join the Seagoing Cowboys and help other people in need all around the world.

F-cowboy296,"The Seagoing Cowboys program. The program where you get to have adventures of visiting amazing places and helping others. Luke particapated in the Seagoing Cowboys program and he had blast in the program. Thats why he wants others to participate in the program so they can have great time with their friends or themselves. In Luke's adventure he visited New Orleans, Greece, Europe, China, Venice, Italy, and even a excavated castle in Crete and marvled at the Panama Canal on his way to china. Also you have to help others by feeding caring animals two or three times a day but it is all worth it. But sometimes you have to be careful in the one of the trips because you might get in a accident. Luke got a injury from slipping down on a slippery ladder and landed on his backside on rainy day. You can also do some fun activities on board. In Luke's adventure the cowboys played baseball, volleyball games, table tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, and even reading. So thats why i think others should participate in the program so they can have an amazing adventure.","

F-cowboy297,"The reason he wants to join the program is that he wants to help people. Another reason is that his friend is going too! He is also going because he gets to see China, Uurope, and Europe. But the main reaon he is going is t help people and animals that are shipped overseas.

To support Luke's claim, in the text it states that, ""To help these countries recover their food supplys, animals, and more, 44 nations joined together to form UNRRA (the United Nations Relif and Rehabilitation Administration). UNRRA hired Seagoing Cowboys to take care of horses, yound cows, and mules that were shipped overseas.""

To conclude my essay, here is some infromation about Luke and Don's journy! For fun they played: volleyball,baseball, table-tennis tournaments,fencing,boxing,reading,whittling, and games. They also played them to help pass the time. The trip also made Luke ""aware of people of other countries and their needs. For Don's expirince it was almost the same!","

F-cowboy298,"Hello, I am here to tell you why I believe that people participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program. I think that would be a good way to see the world and go place you never been before and you can go over seas and help other countries in need.

In the story A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves it state in paragraph 4, in World War two over in Europe and many other places they was left in ruins so 44 nations joined togethere to form a UURRA and they hired ""Seagoing Cowboys"" to take care of the animals they was shipping over seas. That is why I believe participating in the Seagoing Cowboys program is a good thing cause you can help other countrys in need.

In the story it sate i paragraph 6 that the boy Luke that was in the Seagoing Program he was over seas for two weeks before he had got to china. That is one of the reason why i think that being in the Seagoing Cowboys is a good way for you to go places you never been before

Last, the passage state in paragraph 9 that being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more that a adventure for Luke Bomberger. This is why I choose to think that it is a great idea to be in the Seagoing Cowboys program cause you can see stuff that you never in your life seen before and have adventures.

This shows why I have stick to believe that it is good idea for people to participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program.","

F-cowboy299,"The Seagoing Cowboys program was probably the best thing that ever happened to me. In the Seagoing Cowboys program, we sail to Europe (and many other countries) and see magnificant sights on the way. The Seagoing Cowboys in a huge opportunity that you should take!

The concept of the Seagoing Cowboys it to help countries recover their food supplies, animals, and more. If you join the UNRRA (the United Nations Relief and Rehibilitation Administration) Seagoing Cowboys you will not regret it. You will be having a great time, while helping other people and making new friends on the boat. While I was on my cattle-rides I have visited many places like Venice, Italy, Europe, China, and many other fasinating landscapes. Being on the Seagoing Cowboys also taught me that work can be fun! During free time, you could enjoy a wide variety of activities including table tennis, boxing, fencing, whittling, and many other games.

The years that I participated in the Seagoing Cowboys program were some of the best years of my life. Joining the Seagoing Cowboys program is a once-in-a-lifetime experience that no one should pass up on! ","

F-cowboy300,"'' Do you think that it would be fun to be a Seagoing Cowboy?'', Parker questioned

'' I think that it would be a great idea. ,I stated We could go on the ships to see different countries on our free time and we could have fun watching the animals.''

Many resonsons why I think that you should join the Seagoing Cowboy program are you can help out people and you can visit cool places while you are traveling. Also you could get a chance to learn how it feels to help someone out that really needs it like Luke did.

Luke also got the opportunities to see China and Europe, the Acropolis in Greece, take a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, a city with streets of water, and he toured a excavated castle in Crete and he saw the Panama Canal on his way to China, like you could if you did something like this.

Also if you did this you would have the opportunity to see and travel the different oceans like Luke did in his travels.

My conclusion is if you join the Seagoing Cowboy program you will enjoy the sights you see and the wonderful feeling of helping out people ineed in other countries.

I think this because in the article it says ''Being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more than an adventure for Luke Bomberger. It opened up the world to him. I'm grateful for the opportunity,'' he says ''It made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs.'' And that

Awareness stayed with him, leading his family to host a number of international students and exchange vistiors for many years. That is why I think you should join the Seagoing Cowboy program.            ","
